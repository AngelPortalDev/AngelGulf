                    <p>
                      Emirates Identity Authority (Eida) confirmed that the ID
                      number issued for each individual, whether a citizen or a
                      resident, is registered in the population register system,
                      and is fixed and may not be modified or changed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      It is a random number consisting of 15 digits, including a
                      four-digit part that may match the year of birth of the ID
                      card holder; however, the said part of the ID number does
                      not match the year of birth necessarily and the figures
                      mentioned do not represent the approved field that
                      determines the date of birth of the card holder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Emirates Identity Authority said in a press release that
                      the ID number is allocated for its holder for life and may
                      not be given to anyone else.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      It is a unique number that may not be changed nor
                      replicated, whether for citizens or residents, pointing
                      out that in case the ID holder changed his date of birth,
                      this does not allow him in any way to change the ID number
                      issued to him, and in case the resident cancelled his
                      residence visa and left the country, his ID number is not
                      cancelled and a new ID card under the same number will be
                      issued to him once he returns to the country.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The ID number constitutes a way to verify the identity of
                      the person and all the information records related to him
                      are linked to the said number.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Abdul Aziz Al Maamari, Director of Government and
                      Community Liaison Office at Emirates Identity Authority,
                      explained that the ID number is divided into four parts:
                      the first one consisting of the first three digits
                      represents the international code of the UAE, followed by
                      a four-digit part that may, and does not necessarily,
                      match the year the birth of the card holder.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Al Maamari pointed out the importance of distinguishing
                      between the ID number and the card number on the right of
                      the back side of the card, which is affixed upon printing
                      the cards in the Emirates Card Factory or through the
                      decentralised printing system in customer service centers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      He added that the front side of the ID card contains the
                      basic information of its holder, i.e. the ID number, the
                      name, nationality, personal photo and smart chip where all
                      the individual’s personal and biometric data are stored to
                      be read automatically using the e-reader.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      He added that the front side of the ID card contains the
                      basic information of its holder, i.e. the ID number, the
                      name, nationality, personal photo and smart chip where all
                      the individual’s personal and biometric data are stored to
                      be read automatically using the e-reader.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      He pointed out that the ID card is the main reference to
                      verify the identity of individuals especially that it
                      includes all the personal data of its holder, including
                      the personal photo and fingerprints, as well as the
                      passport details and the individual civil record number
                      for citizens and the passport and residence details for
                      residents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Al Maamari pointed out that most of the bodies,
                      institutions and companies in the state are updating the
                      details of their customers and the records related thereto
                      and are linking the same to the identity number in order
                      to reduce the duplication of records and so that the ID
                      number becomes the main reference for the record of the
                      individual which facilitates the process of linking the
                      services providers systems based on the same number as the
                      title to access the customer record.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      He stressed the keenness of Emirates Identity Authority to
                      develop the smart identity card issued to every citizen
                      and resident of all ages, to expand the range of its uses
                      as a main reference to define and verify the personal
                      identity of the individual, and to offer the opportunity
                      for more public and private sectors organisations to
                      provide their services based on the ID card, especially
                      that it has unique features that ensure the highest levels
                      of security and accuracy of the data contained therein
                      through three main features, as it is a smart card,
                      includes the electronic signature to verify the identity
                      and the biometric data "the fingerprint", as well as the
                      ID number, and the criteria of the security level (EAL5
                      +), which is one of the highest possible levels of
                      security for electronic chips, and which provides a
                      maximum protection level for the card to limit
                      manipulation and falsification of the data stored in the
                      electronic chip.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It is noteworthy that the Emirates Identity Authority
                      seeks within the framework of its second objective in the
                      Strategic Plan 2014-2016 to "activate and expand the range
                      of uses of the identity card in the various sectors in the
                      country and to activate the ID card as a key reference to
                      define and verify the identity," by providing verification
                      and identification services through various channels, and
                      by empowering and expanding the services in the public
                      sector as well as by promoting Emirates Identity Authority
                      and informing the users about the services it provides.
