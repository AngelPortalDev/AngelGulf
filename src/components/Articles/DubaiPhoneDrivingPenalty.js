                      Currently phone-drivers are fined Dh200 and get 4 black
                      points - may go up to Dh1,000 and 12 black points

                      Motorists found using their mobile phones while driving
                      should be penalised heavily, Colonel Saif Muhair Al
                      Mazroui, Director General of the Dubai Traffic Police said
                      on Wednesday.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Al Mazroui said that using a mobile phone while driving is
                      a major cause of fatal accidents on the road, according to
                      a report in Emarat Al Youm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The Dubai Police official was speaking at the launch of a
                      campaign to raise awareness about the dangers involved in
                      using the mobile phone while driving. The campaign will
                      run till February 18.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Those who are found using their mobile phone while driving
                      are fined Dh200 and four black points. However, this does
                      not commensurate with the magnitude of the risks posed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Al Mazroui said that Dubai Police is seeking tighter
                      measures for those found speaking on their phones or
                      taking selfies while driving. He added that the Federal
                      Traffic Council had earlier sought for the penalty to be
                      increased to Dh1,000 and 12 black points, and impounding
                      of the car for a month.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The Dubai Police official also stated that drivers should
                      not use their mobile phone even when their vehicle was
                      waiting for the signal to change at the traffic lights.
                      That would also be counted as a violation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      He said that recently a horrific mishap occurred when a
                      driver rammed into a heavy truck as he was not paying
                      adequate attention to where he was going. The impact of
                      the collision was fatal.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      When the driver's body was retrieved from the smashed car,
                      he was found holding a mobile phone in his hand, which
                      made it clear that the driver's attention was diverted at
                      the time of accident.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      He emphasised that the risk was not limited to drivers
                      only but also to bystanders.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      He narrated an incident where a person was walking on the
                      footpath and his mobile fell on the road. When he bent
                      down to pick up the phone, unfortunately, he did not pay
                      attention and check if the road was free of vehicular
                      traffic. This careless move led to his death as he was hit
                      by a speeding car and died on the spot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      WAl Mazroui said that Dubai Police had issued fines to
                      49,643 drivers for using their mobile phones for talking,
                      surfing the internet or taking selfies while driving
                      during the past year. More than 45,000 such cases were
                      recorded in 2014 and 35,734 in 2013.
