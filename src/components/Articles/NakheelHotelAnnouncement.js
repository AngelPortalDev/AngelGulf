                 Dubai-based Nakheel on Wednesday announced the signing of a Letter of Intent for a management agreement with Thailand’s Minor Hotel Group for a 372-room hotel at Ibn Battuta Mall. Under the proposed agreement, the hotel will be managed under the Avani Hotels & Resorts brand. The 14-storey hotel – one of two Nakheel hotels at Ibn Battuta and one of 10 in its overall hotel portfolio – will have direct access to the mall and a link to Dubai Metro.

              The new agreement is the second collaboration between Nakheel and Minor Hotel Group in a span of five months. In September last year, the two companies announced a planned joint venture for a 500-room Avani beachfront resort at Deira Islands, a 15.3-square kilometre coastal city.Nakheel Chairman Ali Rashid Lootah said: “We continue to work with reputable international partners to bring new brands to Dubai, further enhancing and diversifying the emirate’s hotel accommodation offering in line with the government of Dubai’s vision.”

              Dillip Rajakarier, CEO, Minor Hotel Group, said: “Following the recent announcement about our strategic partnership with Nakheel and the development of the UAE’s first Avani at Deira Islands, we are thrilled that a Letter of Intent has already been signed for the second Avani in the UAE.Avani Ibn Battuta forms part of Nakheel’s 4.7 million square feet expansion to Ibn Battuta Mall, which will create another 766,000 square feet of shopping, dining and entertainment space. The mall already welcomes around 22 million a year.

              The 372-room Premier Inn is currently under construction and due to open this year. Nakheel plans 10 hotels, with around 4,000 rooms between them. The first – a 251-room ibis Styles hotel at Dragon Mart – opened earlier this month.
