                New set of questions that test the candidate’s creativity and
                flair
              </h2>
              <p>
                Employers in Dubai and the rest of the UAE are steering away
                from the ‘general’ types of questions – what are your strengths,
                where do you see yourself in 5 years, etc. – and introducing a
                new set of questions that test the candidate’s creativity and
                flair, a new report shows. If you are on the lookout for a job
                in the UAE and are trying to make sense of your initial job
                search, this recent data can help you narrow down your options.
                A report from dubizzle, a UAE-based classifieds website, reveals
                the most common questions that the country’s employers ask
                candidates.
              </p>
              <p>
                “The most popular question asked of an accounting jobseeker was:
                ‘Do you have experience as an income auditor?’ while for sales,
                most employers enquired about previous sales experience in the
                UAE and GCC,” dubizzle’s 2015 job report highlights. For
                healthcare professionals, the most common question posed was
                “are you a female HADD/DHA-licensed or exam-passed nurse?” For
                electrical engineer, employers wanted to know if the candidate
                had passed the Dubai Municipality test and for administrative
                jobs, the most commonly asked question was: “Are you based in
                Dubai?”
              </p>
              <p>
                Job postings for infographic designers ask for certification or
                a degree in a relevant field, and real estate positions seek a
                valid Rera card. Certifications are also a prerequisite in
                medical healthcare and engineering as some common questions. For
                example, it’s good to know what kind of jobs are advertised the
                most; ones that have many candidates applying for; who all are
                your competitors and the kind of question that the employers are
                most likely to ask you.
              </p>
              <p>Most popular job in UAE</p>
              <p>
                It’s raining accountants in the UAE. According to the report,
                accounting is the most popular job sector in Dubai in 2015, with
                more than 38,000 individual ads posted and a staggering 10
                million applicants vying for the roles. That works out to about
                263 candidates per advertised accountancy vacancy. The
                secretarial and sales sectors follow, with more job ads posted
                (42,000 and 77,000, respectively) but fewer applicants (5
                million for secretarial posting and 4 million for sales jobs).
                That works out to an average of 119 applications per secretarial
                job and just about 52 applications per sales vacancy. More than
                33,000 jobs were posted last year in real estate, with just over
                half a million (522,000) applicants while the transportation
                sector followed with fewer ads (22,000) but more applicants
                (825,000), the data reveals.

              <p>Abu Dhabi jobs</p>
              <p>
                In Abu Dhabi too, accounting was the most listed sector in the
                job section but unlike Dubai, it was followed by
                hospitality/restaurant jobs, secretarial, sales and
                medical/healthcare jobs. Finance and accounting, however, have
                taken a dip in January of this year. The latest Monster
                Employment Index for the country shows the sector has been UAE’s
                lowest growth occupations last month when compared to the same
                period in 2015. Considering the year-over-year growth (January
                2015 and January 2016), the Monster Index shows that finance and
                accounting, marketing & communications/arts/creative and
                customer service were the worst performers among the occupations
                that the index tracks.
