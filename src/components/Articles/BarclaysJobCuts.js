                      Bank exploring shuttering of cash equity sales across Mena
                      and Central Europe: memo
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Barclays has embarked on a fresh round of job cuts to its
                      investment banking business worldwide on Thursday which
                      would result in a complete exit from cash equities in
                      Asia, an internal memo showed, as new Chief Executive Jes
                      Staley wields the axe in a bid to slash costs and boost
                      returns.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The harsher-than-expected cuts are among the most sweeping
                      worldwide culls by an investment bank in recent years, as
                      Staley in common with peers at other European lenders
                      moves to reduce costs amid a tough global environment for
                      banks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Barclays will shutter its investment banking businesses in
                      countries including Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia,
                      Philippines, Russia, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand, the
                      memo said, with those markets to be covered from financial
                      hub cities in their respective regions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      A spokesman for Barclays in Hong Kong declined to comment
                      on the cuts because they are not public.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      With 10 of Europe’s biggest lenders announcing 130,000 job
                      losses since June, bank chief executives are looking to
                      cut in businesses where they lack scale to focus on more
                      profitable markets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The reduction in jobs are also in response to the turmoil
                      in global equities and commodities markets, which is
                      making it harder for investment banks to make money in the
                      traditional business lines.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The cuts in the London-headquartered bank were announced
                      to staff in meetings on Thursday across the Asia-Pacific
                      region, according a source with direct knowledge. .
                    </p>
                    <p>“Asia is bearing the brunt,” the source added.</p>
                    <p>
                      The total number of jobs to be shed in the latest Barclays
                      reduction is unclear, but a source with direct knowledge
                      of the matter said the Asian equities cuts alone could
                      total about 200 people. A separate source with knowledge
                      of the cuts said the Asia total would be 450 people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The Financial Times previously reported that Barclays
                      would shed as many as 1,000 jobs worldwide in the latest
                      cull.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Barclays is also exploring the sale of its global precious
                      metals business, the memo said, as well as shuttering cash
                      equity sales across Central Europe, the Middle East and
                      North Africa, the memo showed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The lender will also end its onshore markets coverage in
                      Brazil.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Reuters on January 5 reported the cuts in the Asia
                      investment banking business and exits from South Korea and
                      Taiwan, as Barclays retreated from peripheral Asian
                      businesses to focus on hubs including Hong Kong and
                      Singapore.
