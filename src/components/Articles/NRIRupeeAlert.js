                      Rupee in real danger of breaching sub-Rs20-exchange rate
                      against UAE dirham in 2016
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The beleaguered Indian rupee traded at Rs18.49 against the
                      UAE dirham at about 9.45pm last Friday, not too far from
                      the lifetime low of Rs18.55 vs Dh1 (end-of-day) that it
                      made more than two years ago.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In US dollar terms, the rupee fell down to Rs67.91 vs $1
                      this Friday, and analysts maintain that it’s only a matter
                      of time before the Indian currency plunges below the
                      68-mark against the US dollar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Ideed, on September 3, 2013, the rupee made an intra-day
                      low of 68.845 per dollar, or Rs18.74 against the UAE
                      dirham. A quick look at the 'live' Indian rupee options on
                      the NSE and Dubai Gold and Currency Exchange on Monday
                      (January 18, 2016) suggests that a section of punters
                      believe the rupee is set to breach that lifetime low
                      within the first quarter of this year.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      When that happens, however, it won’t be the end of the
                      rupee’s woes, with even further depreciation likely in the
                      short term.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      According to some reports, the rupee is in danger of
                      breaching the Rs74-mark against the US dollar this year,
                      translating into a sub-Rs20-exchange rate against the UAE
                      dirham.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      That figure may seem surreal to a section of Indian expats
                      who, until the previous global financial crisis, were used
                      to remitting money at half that rate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Fast forward to today, and the rupee has lost more than 73
                      per cent of its value in nine years and a couple of
                      months, and is likely to slip further within the next six
                      to eight months.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The rupee has traditionally been a depreciating currency,
                      says Promoth Manghat, CEO of the Abu Dhabi-based UAE
                      Exchange, one of the world’s largest remittance companies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “Historically, the Indian rupee has been a depreciating
                      currency, declining by between 6 and 7 per cent every
                      year,” he told Emirates 24|7 in an earlier interview.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Here’s a bit of trivia for you. It may come as news to
                      some that the rupee started at dollar parity in 1947, when
                      India achieved its independence. At that time, the rupee
                      followed the par value system, wherein the value of rupee
                      was pegged at 4.15 grains of fine gold. The first
                      depreciation of the rupee happened in 1966, when its value
                      fell overnight by almost 56 per cent to 1.83 grains of
                      fine gold.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      That ‘devaluation’ meant that in the foreign exchange
                      market, the rupee was cheaper by 37.5 per cent against the
                      US dollar, from Rs4.75 per $1, it fell to Rs7.50 in a
                      single stroke.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      With that perspective, a further decline of 8 per cent in
                      the next 12 months isn’t out of the question, and an
                      exchange rate of Rs74 against $1 (Rs20.14 vs Dh1) is quite
                      likely given the current dismal form of the Indian
                      currency
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The past week saw the rupee plummet by more than 1.5 per
                      cent, its biggest weekly drop in about a year-and-a-half.
                      The benchmark BSE Sensex stock market index exaggerated
                      the rupee’s weekly decline, sinking by 1.9 per cent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The Sensex is now down 6.5 per cent this year so far, with
                      the rupee shedding more than 2.5 per cent of its worth in
                      the same period.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      From those lofty peaks last year, the rupee is weaker by
                      almost 11 per cent while the benchmark equity index is
                      down 17.6 per cent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Just one year ago, the rupee was trading at Rs16.68
                      against Dh1 (January 28, 2015) while the Sensex was
                      scaling new heights and was soaring at 29,681 points.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So, what happened and, more importantly, is it likely to
                      continue?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To be fair, there are plenty of reasons for the decline,
                      but we list the top 5 that we believe have been and will
                      continue to impact the rupee the most going forward.
                    </p>

                      #1 Ballooning current account deficit: India’s exports
                      have been falling short of covering its imports (largely
                      of oil and gold) in recent years, and that’s been the bane
                      of its problems. From a deficit of 1.3 per cent of GDP in
                      2007-08, the CAD more than tripled to 4.8 per cent in
                      2012-2013.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      #2 Shrinking forex reserves: On January 16, the country
                      announced that its foreign exchange reserves dipped below
                      the $350-billion-mark for the first time in 15 weeks, with
                      the year’s first fortnight witnessing an outgo of $3.22bn
                      of foreign funds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The reserves act as a cushion against dollar outflows and
                      are a major weapon on the arsenal of the country’s apex
                      bank to control volatility in the forex markets. In the
                      past, the Reserve Bank of India has been known to pump the
                      market with dollars from its reserves if the rupee
                      depreciates violently. Thinner forex reserves mean that
                      the RBI’s reactions will be timid at best.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      #3 Slowing global growth: Investors are getting
                      increasingly wary of the economic slowdown that seems to
                      be spreading by the day. Among the BRICs, Brazil and
                      Russia are already in recession, and China’s growth is
                      slowing down dramatically.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The past six months have seen investors pull out a mammoth
                      $600 billion from China, at the rate of $100bn a month. It
                      still has plenty ($3.3 trillion) worth of foreign
                      investments left, but the same cannot be said for any
                      other emerging economy, including India. The only saving
                      grace is that India is a net commodity importer and,
                      therefore, the low global commodity prices help its
                      finances unlike the other major emerging economies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      But if the world does fall into recession, there will be
                      less demand for India’s soft exports (services), and
                      that’ll translate into an imported recession. Even if
                      there’s no hard landing, a global slowdown will continue
                      to impact the Indian currency negatively.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      #4 US recovery and end of QE: The US Federal Reserve
                      raised interest rates by a quarter percentage point in
                      December 2105 after almost a decade of near-zero borrowing
                      cost for US consumers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The Fed has indicated that it will be hiking the interest
                      rate further this year on the back of a sustained US
                      economic growth. This is already and will continue to
                      boost the US dollar against other global currencies, thus
                      exacerbating the woes of emerging market currencies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The likelihood of further hikes this year doesn’t bode
                      well for the Indian currency (and other emerging market
                      currencies), and will put further downward pressure on the
                      rupee.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      #5 Flight to safety: When times are tough, the smart money
                      looks for safe avenues (like the greenback and bullion)
                      and tends to quit emerging markets fairly quickly. We have
                      seen this happening over the past few months, and most
                      analysts see this trend intensifying going forward this
                      year.
                    </p>
