                    <p>
                      The UAE’s Ministry of Labour has recently made several
                      changes to the country’s Labour Law with the aim of making
                      the employee-employer relationship more transparent, as
                      well as mutually beneficial.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The new labour decrees were implemented at the beginning
                      of the year on the directives of Labour Minister Saqr
                      Ghobash.
                    </p>

                      In response to readers seeking more clarity, Emirates 24|7

                      experts explaining the details.

                      to promote transparency or openness between the employer
                      and the employee.

                    <p>
                      In this piece, we ask Thenji Macanda, Senior Associate at
                      law firm Taylor Wessing, about how the changes in
                      terminating a limited and unlimited contract will empower
                      the expat workers in the country.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      She lists a number of things to keep in mind when
                      terminating limited or unlimited employment contracts, as
                      well as explains why a no-objection certificate (NOC) is
                      not a pre-requisite anymore for switching jobs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “These amendments to the law should make it easier and
                      quicker for expatriate workers to terminate their
                      employment contracts,” she told Emirates 24|7.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      “Historically, employees required a no-objection
                      certificate [NOC] from their employer to leave their
                      employment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “It was also fairly simple for an employer to place a
                      labour ban on an employee where the employee had not
                      completed at least two years’ service or had terminated a
                      limited contract before the period of the contract had
                      finished,” she says.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      “The new changes should increase job mobility for
                      employees and make it easier for workers to change
                      employers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “As a result of this, we think that employers will seek to
                      improve employees' work conditions and offer better
                      packages as a way to retain staff,” she added.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Procedure to follow when terminating a fixed-term
                      employment contract
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Elaborating on the UAE Ministerial Decree 765 of 2015 on
                      Termination of a Limited Contract, Thenji Macanda explains
                      that for employees who are employed on a limited (fixed
                      term) employment contract, the relationship can be
                      terminated on
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Expiration of the fixed term - not renewed</li>
                      <li>
                        Article 120 of the Labour law (termination for cause);
                        and
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Unilateral termination by either party subject to
                        compliance with certain formalities.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                      These formalities include that each has to notify the
                      other party (maximum of a 3 month notice); the parties
                      have to honour the contractual obligations and indemnify
                      the other with the agreed compensation between one and
                      three months for early termination.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The term of a limited contract cannot extend over two
                      years (maximum term).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The reduction of the fixed term to a two-year limit should
                      bring more flexibility to employees who may want to leave
                      their employer and the term will also be in line with the
                      majority of UAE visas which has a two-year life span.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Procedure to follow when terminating an unlimited
                      employment contract
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      For those on unlimited contract, the decree states the
                      relationship can be terminated with mutual consent, by
                      giving a notice between 1 and 3 months under article 120
                      of the UAE Labour Law (Termination for Cause).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The parties involved are to honour obligations throughout
                      the notice period. For terminations all parties should
                      follow legal procedures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The unlimited employment contract is by its very nature
                      more flexible and currently parties are permitted to
                      terminate the employment contract subject to each party
                      giving notice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The major amendment in respect of unlimited contracts is
                      the capped duration of notice at three months.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It is a common feature in the UAE to have senior
                      executives and teachers constrained to six months’ notice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The decrees are intended to create a mechanism in which
                      all employees are free to leave soon after notice is
                      submitted.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This may call for employers to think of other mechanisms
                      of retaining staff, such as long-term incentive plans that
                      vest periodically, or deferred bonus schemes, highlights
                      the expert at Taylor Wessing.
                    </p>

                      She lists a number of things to keep in mind when
                      terminating limited or unlimited employment contracts, as
                      well as explains why a no-objection certificate (NOC) is
                      not a pre-requisite anymore for switching jobs.

                      “These amendments to the law should make it easier and
                      quicker for expatriate workers to terminate their
                      employment contracts,” she told Emirates 24|7.

                    <p>
                      “Historically, employees required a no-objection
                      certificate [NOC] from their employer to leave their
                      employment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “It was also fairly simple for an employer to place a
                      labour ban on an employee where the employee had not
                      completed at least two years’ service or had terminated a
                      limited contract before the period of the contract had
                      finished,” she says.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      “The new changes should increase job mobility for
                      employees and make it easier for workers to change
                      employers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “As a result of this, we think that employers will seek to
                      improve employees' work conditions and offer better
                      packages as a way to retain staff,” she added.

                      Procedure to follow when terminating a fixed-term
                      employment contract
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Elaborating on the UAE Ministerial Decree 765 of 2015 on
                      Termination of a Limited Contract, Thenji Macanda explains
                      that for employees who are employed on a limited (fixed
                      term) employment contract, the relationship can be
                      terminated on
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Expiration of the fixed term - not renewed</li>
                      <li>
                        Article 120 of the Labour law (termination for cause);
                        and
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Unilateral termination by either party subject to
                        compliance with certain formalities.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                      These formalities include that each has to notify the
                      other party (maximum of a 3 month notice); the parties
                      have to honour the contractual obligations and indemnify
                      the other with the agreed compensation between one and
                      three months for early termination.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The term of a limited contract cannot extend over two
                      years (maximum term).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The reduction of the fixed term to a two-year limit should
                      bring more flexibility to employees who may want to leave
                      their employer and the term will also be in line with the
                      majority of UAE visas which has a two-year life span.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Procedure to follow when terminating an unlimited
                      employment contract
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      For those on unlimited contract, the decree states the
                      relationship can be terminated with mutual consent, by
                      giving a notice between 1 and 3 months under article 120
                      of the UAE Labour Law (Termination for Cause).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The parties involved are to honour obligations throughout
                      the notice period. For terminations all parties should
                      follow legal procedures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The unlimited employment contract is by its very nature
                      more flexible and currently parties are permitted to
                      terminate the employment contract subject to each party
                      giving notice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The major amendment in respect of unlimited contracts is
                      the capped duration of notice at three months.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It is a common feature in the UAE to have senior
                      executives and teachers constrained to six months’ notice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The decrees are intended to create a mechanism in which
                      all employees are free to leave soon after notice is
                      submitted.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This may call for employers to think of other mechanisms
                      of retaining staff, such as long-term incentive plans that
                      vest periodically, or deferred bonus schemes, highlights
                      the expert at Taylor Wessing.
