                      Recruitment Specialists, Payroll Managers Among Those In
                      Demand
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The continued business evolution in the UAE and the region
                      at large is fuelling demand for talented HR professionals.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Those who are most in demand right now include recruitment
                      specialists, payroll managers, HR officers, senior HR
                      directors, senior learning and development managers, as
                      per a survey from recruitment firm Robert Half.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Employers are most on the look-out for ones with
                      multinational corporation experience with a strong
                      knowledge of UAE employment laws, those who have HR system
                      knowledge, including SAP and Oracle as well as performance
                      management applications and CIPD/SHRM qualified,
                      preferably with a degree in HR or psychology.

                    <p>
                      The survey data highlights that it’s difficult to find HR
                      professionals with specialist skills in learning and
                      development, remuneration and benefits, and organisational
                      culture. Those with longer term tenure in previous roles
                      and 15-plus years’ experience are in highest demand.

                      “Companies in these sectors are the most likely to develop
                      their teams in anticipation of imminent revenue growth so
                      require HR support to both fill their vacant positions and
                      ensure compliance.”

                    <p>
                      As the demand for technical skills and knowledge is going
                      up finding the right candidate remains a challenge for
                      heads of HR in the region.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The study reveals that almost half (48 per cent) of senior
                      HR leaders say that a lack of niche, technical experts is
                      holding back their recruitment efforts, while a further 30
                      per cent say that general demand for talented
                      professionals is causing concerns.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Lack of commercial and business skills among potential
                      candidates is a problem for 15 per cent, while a small
                      minority (7 per cent) say that the general slowdown in
                      hiring during the recession has resulted in a lack of
                      candidates with the right skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The study maintains that there remains a trend for
                      companies to maximise the cost-effectiveness of their HR
                      operations by centralising or decentralising processes and
                      outsourcing them to third-party providers operating
                      offshore in India or Eastern Europe.
