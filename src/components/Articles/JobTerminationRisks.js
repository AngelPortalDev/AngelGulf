                    </h2>
                    <p>
                      Addressing the various issues in the job market in UAE,
                      the Ministry of Human Resources & Emiratisation (MOHRE)
                      revised the labour law in UAE. Here are the new updates.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Work Models</h4>

                    <p>
                      The regulatory body has introduced multiple work models in

                    <h4>Introduction of Visa Category</h4>

                    <p>
                      The law ministry has introduced pivotal changes in the
                      present immigration landscape. The new law has given 12
                      types of permits:
                    </p>

                      <li>
                        Transfer work permit for non-national workers that allow

                      </li>

                      </li>

                        Freelance permit is for individuals seeking
                        self-employment opportunities without any valid
                        employment contract or sponsorship from any employer. It
                        is the same as the freelancer visa available to expats
                        to work in Dubai’s free zone.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Employee Contract</h4>
                    <p>
                      The new contract has abolished the unlimited-term contract
                      provision and has introduced a limited-term contract which
                      cannot be for more than three years. The new Dubai labour
                      law has advised employers to revise the work contract of
                      expats who are on unlimited-term contracts to
                      limited-term.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Scope of Employees’ Work</h4>
                    <p>
                      This law states that an employer cannot broaden the role
                      and responsibilities of an employee on a term contract or
                      assign responsibility other than what has been dictated to
                      him at the time of joining. Employers can do it only if
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        The employee has given his consent in writing for the
                        change of responsibility.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The revised scope of work should be up to 90 days only.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Covenant Not to Compete</h4>
                    <p>
                      This law outlines the time and circumstances where a
                      covenant not to compete clause would be applicable. Also,
                      it explains when an employer can invoke this law on an
                      employee.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        If the employee has access to the trade secret or the
                        client’s information of the employer, the employer can
                        invoke the covenant not to compete for a clause on the
                        employee at the time of his release
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The non-compete clause does not exceed two years term.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Non-Discrimination Clause</h4>
                    <p>
                      The federation has introduced a new point in the UAE
                      labour law to protect the rights of some nationals. The
                      following are the new points:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        The female employee working in the same role should
                        receive equal remuneration.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Employers must ensure the protection of the rights of
                        vulnerable groups from incidences like harassment,
                        bullying and violence.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Leave</h4>

                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Female employees are entitled to 60 days of maternity
                        leave irrespective of their length of service within the
                        organization. Out of 60 days of leave, 45 days should be
                        at full-pay and 15 days at half-pay.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        An employee is entitled to 5 working days of bereavement
                        leave.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Employees who have completed their two years of
                        employment are entitled to ten days of study leave
                        provided he is enrolled at a certified institute in UAE.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Both parents are entitled to five working days of
                        paternal leave. One can take it in continuation or in
                        breaks within six months of the child’s birth.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Workplace Regulations</h4>
                    <p>
                      An organization with more than 50 employees has to abide
                      by work-related rules. Those not following the same must
                      revise their workplace-related guidelines.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Disciplinary Penalties and Financial Exposure</h4>
                    <p>
                      The new rule states that all employers should have proper
                      investigation management and appropriate mechanism for
                      case resolution in a timely manner. It has defined
                      penalties for breaches. They are written notice, deduction
                      from remuneration, suspension from work, promotion denial,
                      and deprivation of periodic increments.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Unemployment Insurance Scheme</h4>
                    <p>
                      The federation has recently introduced an unemployment
                      insurance scheme for workers in the private and public
                      sectors. It will come into effect in 2023 and cover 60% of
                      the worker’s basic salary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The emirate government will compensate the insured
                      employees with up to AED 20,000 in cash if they lose their
                      employment (for any reason). Financial aid will be given
                      to individuals yearning for support in case of employment
                      loss. The government will continue providing the benefits
                      until the person finds subsequent employment. However, to
                      get unemployment insurance benefits, an employee has to
                      contribute a small amount to the fund every month.
                      Further, the scheme is not applicable to expats, pension
                      holders, children below the age of 18 years, individuals
                      on contractual jobs, etc.
                    </p>
