                      Arabic, English are two main languages; worker must be
                      able to understand third language
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The UAE’s Ministry of Labour recently approved 11
                      languages to be presented to workers within their job
                      offers, labour contracts and annexes, following the newly
                      launched labour decrees that were implemented at the
                      beginning of the year on the directives of Labour Minister
                      Saqr Ghobash.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Humaid bin Deemas, Assistant Under-Secretary for Labour
                      Affairs, said, "Arabic and English are two main languages
                      in each job offer, labour contract and annexes presented
                      to the worker, in addition to a third language that the
                      applicant can understand. This applies both to workers
                      coming from outside and those residing in the UAE that
                      seek a new job or are required to move from one company to
                      another."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      He explained, "The other approved nine languages are
                      Bengali, Chinese, Dari, Hindi, Malayalam, Nepalese, Sri
                      Lankan, Tamil and Urdu, languages which have been picked
                      according to statistics highlighting the highest number of
                      workers using them."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      "Adding these new languages confirms the ministry's
                      keenness to promote transparency between all parties on
                      the terms and conditions of employment and their rights
                      and obligations, before coming to the country to resume
                      their duties."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Earlier this year, the Ministry of Labour began the
                      application of new measures to extract work permits under
                      which the employer is committed to enclose job offers
                      signed by the worker for those classified in the first,
                      second and third levels, while thumbprints are required
                      for those in fourth and fifth levels.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      "Workers must look into job offers and annexes in their
                      preferred languages before signing the contracts to reach
                      a healthy work relationship between both sides. Annexes
                      must be reviewed as they hold a number of labour laws and
                      amendments," bin Deemas said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      He added, "If proven that workers did not go through the
                      annexes before signing the labour contract, the ministry
                      will take the measures set forth in the Council of
                      Ministers Decision No. 40 of 2014 against the employer,
                      who shall face a Dh20,000 fine for submitting incorrect
                      data to the ministry."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      "If the worker recognises the nature of his work after
                      reviewing his job offer as well as the terms and
                      conditions printed within the annexes before the official
                      hiring, this contributes to reducing labour disputes,
                      especially since previous cases show that after joining
                      their jobs, workers claim a lack of commitment to working
                      conditions that were agreed upon verbally between both
                      ends, therefore, the ministry launched new contracting
                      procedures," he added.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Both labour contracts and annexes are available on the
                      ministry's website and workers can access these documents
                      after filling in nationality, passport number and
                      transaction type fields on-line.
                    </p>
