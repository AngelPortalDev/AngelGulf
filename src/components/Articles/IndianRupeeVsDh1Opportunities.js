                      Indian expats can make a killing by investing wisely at
                      one of the most favourable exchange rates – ever
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The Indian rupee declined to to a low of Rs18.56 against
                      one UAE dirham (Rs68.17 against the US dollar) at 8.30pm
                      UAE time (5.30pm GMT) on Wednesday, january 20, 2016,
                      surpassing its September 2013 lifetime low of Rs18.55 vs
                      Dh1.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Several experts expect the beleaguered rupee’s worth to
                      face a further decline in the medium term, and an exchange
                      rate of Rs20 vs Dh1 may be a possibility this year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In fact, Assocham, India’s industry body, sees the recent
                      depreciation of the rupee as a welcome sign for India’s
                      exports, and has called for Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to
                      let the rupee take its natural exchange course unless
                      there is massive fluctuation in the short term.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      “India should allow its currency to slide while the RBI
                      should use ample foreign exchange reserves to defend the
                      currency only if there is a rout situation,” the industry
                      body said in a report.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The body maintains that China’s recent yen devaluation,
                      third in five months, will negatively impact Indian firms
                      which have export exposure to China in sectors such as
                      tyres, pharmaceuticals, steel and organic chemicals
                      textiles due to a volatile change in terms of trade.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      China is among India’s largest trading partners, with
                      Indian exports to China amounting to $11.95 billion in
                      2014-15 while imports stood at a massive $60.39bn,
                      resulting in a trade deficit of $48.44bn for India. Recent
                      successive yuan devaluations threaten to widen that trade
                      deficit, as Indian exports become expensive and,
                      therefore, unviable in some cases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Analysts warn that deteriorating economic indicators in
                      India and across emerging markets bode ill for the Indian
                      currency, which has seen a decline of more than 73 per
                      cent in the past eight years, or more than 7 per cent
                      year-on-year decline.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In the most recent eight months, the rupee has shed 11.35
                      per cent, or more than 1.4 per cent a month.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Given that, it is only a matter of time that the rupee
                      sheds another 8 or so per cent to decline below the
                      Rs20-mark against the UAE dirham (Rs73.46vs $1).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      That is indeed good news for Indian expats in the UAE and
                      across the world who remit money home every month or who
                      may have outstanding financial obligations back home that
                      can be now fulfilled with less of dollars, dirham and
                      dinars as opposed to a year ago.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      On the flip side, any gain is only notional – after all,
                      we spend a majority of our earnings in the currency we
                      earn and in the country we earn it, and only remit perhaps
                      a small proportion of our income every month.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Nevertheless, with the rupee falling to its lowest level
                      ever, the decline is an opportunity for NRIs to clean up
                      their home-market debt or make a fresh investment at one
                      of the most favourable exchange rates ever. Here’s how:
                    </p>
                    <p>1. Remit it</p>
                    <p>
                      The first step to any potential investment – be it in
                      Indian shares, property, or even a fixed-income deposit –
                      will need you to first remit the money, and you should do
                      it while the exchange rate is rewarding. You might want to
                      accumulate your resources (the next salary cheque for most
                      employees is 10 days away).
                    </p>
                    <p>2. Prepay your outstanding debt</p>
                    <p>
                      It is no state secret that Indian nationals like to invest
                      in property, and most NRIs secure a home in India before
                      making property investment in the country they work in or
                      elsewhere. Which means that many of us would have taken
                      out home loans with Indian banks for properties in India?
                      With interest rates beginning to go north now, the
                      interest burden on that mortgage will go up too. It may be
                      time to borrow cheap – some UAE banks and those in other
                      Gulf States with a fixed peg to the dollar are still
                      offering low borrowing rates – and prepay tat outstanding
                      back home. Nevertheless, do your math before going for a
                      prepayment by borrowing afresh and prepay only if you're
                      making a reasonable saving in interest outgo.
                    </p>
                    <p>3. Explore fixed income options</p>
                    <p>
                      The recent revision in the US Federal Reserve’s interest
                      rates has had their echoes heard across the world,
                      including in the Indian banking system. You can still earn
                      handsome returns (up to 9 per cent per annum) in fixed
                      deposit products with some of India’s public sector banks.
                      Keep in mind, though that the rupee could well depreciate
                      at a similar rate, and you may not ‘earn’ anything on the
                      deposit when compared with keeping your dirham or dollars
                      in a non-interest-paying account.
                    </p>

                    <p>4. Invest in Indian shares</p>
                    <p>
                      Okay, this advice comes with a strong disclaimer – the
                      Indian stock market, like others in the world, is
                      undergoing a correction, and could easily fall another 10
                      to 15 per cent from here on. But as the world renowned
                      investor Warren Buffet once famously remarked – be fearful
                      when others are greedy, and greedy when others are
                      fearful. As markets reach their lows, it may be prudent to
                      keep the cash ready and jump on the bandwagon once they’re
                      on an upswing.
                    </p>
                    <p>5. Buy a house in India</p>
                    <p>
                      Again, do your homework before taking the plunge. Although
                      not to the tune of stock markets, but property prices can
                      and do fluctuate and it is best to study the proposed
                      market’s potential movements before making a huge
                      investment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In the end, what you’d like to do with the extra rupees
                      that your dirham are earning today depends on your
                      individual circumstances and investment objectives, but do
                      remember the golden rule of investment – what goes up,
                      comes down and vice-versa.
                    </p>

                      one UAE dirham (Rs68.17 against the US dollar) at 8.30pm
                      UAE time (5.30pm GMT) on Wednesday, january 20, 2016,
                      surpassing its September 2013 lifetime low of Rs18.55 vs
                      Dh1.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Several experts expect the beleaguered rupee’s worth to
                      face a further decline in the medium term, and an exchange
                      rate of Rs20 vs Dh1 may be a possibility this year.

                      In fact, Assocham, India’s industry body, sees the recent
                      depreciation of the rupee as a welcome sign for India’s
                      exports, and has called for Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to
                      let the rupee take its natural exchange course unless
                      there is massive fluctuation in the short term.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      “India should allow its currency to slide while the RBI
                      should use ample foreign exchange reserves to defend the
                      currency only if there is a rout situation,” the industry
                      body said in a report.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The body maintains that China’s recent yen devaluation,
                      third in five months, will negatively impact Indian firms
                      which have export exposure to China in sectors such as
                      tyres, pharmaceuticals, steel and organic chemicals
                      textiles due to a volatile change in terms of trade.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      China is among India’s largest trading partners, with
                      Indian exports to China amounting to $11.95 billion in
                      2014-15 while imports stood at a massive $60.39bn,
                      resulting in a trade deficit of $48.44bn for India. Recent
                      successive yuan devaluations threaten to widen that trade
                      deficit, as Indian exports become expensive and,
                      therefore, unviable in some cases.

                    <p>
                      Analysts warn that deteriorating economic indicators in
                      India and across emerging markets bode ill for the Indian
                      currency, which has seen a decline of more than 73 per
                      cent in the past eight years, or more than 7 per cent
                      year-on-year decline.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In the most recent eight months, the rupee has shed 11.35
                      per cent, or more than 1.4 per cent a month.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Given that, it is only a matter of time that the rupee
                      sheds another 8 or so per cent to decline below the
                      Rs20-mark against the UAE dirham (Rs73.46vs $1).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      That is indeed good news for Indian expats in the UAE and
                      across the world who remit money home every month or who
                      may have outstanding financial obligations back home that
                      can be now fulfilled with less of dollars, dirham and
                      dinars as opposed to a year ago.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      On the flip side, any gain is only notional – after all,
                      we spend a majority of our earnings in the currency we
                      earn and in the country we earn it, and only remit perhaps
                      a small proportion of our income every month.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Nevertheless, with the rupee falling to its lowest level
                      ever, the decline is an opportunity for NRIs to clean up
                      their home-market debt or make a fresh investment at one
                      of the most favourable exchange rates ever. Here’s how:
                    </p>
                    <p>1. Remit it</p>
                    <p>
                      The first step to any potential investment – be it in
                      Indian shares, property, or even a fixed-income deposit –
                      will need you to first remit the money, and you should do
                      it while the exchange rate is rewarding. You might want to
                      accumulate your resources (the next salary cheque for most
                      employees is 10 days away).
                    </p>
                    <p>2. Prepay your outstanding debt</p>
                    <p>
                      It is no state secret that Indian nationals like to invest
                      in property, and most NRIs secure a home in India before
                      making property investment in the country they work in or
                      elsewhere. Which means that many of us would have taken
                      out home loans with Indian banks for properties in India?
                      With interest rates beginning to go north now, the
                      interest burden on that mortgage will go up too. It may be
                      time to borrow cheap – some UAE banks and those in other
                      Gulf States with a fixed peg to the dollar are still
                      offering low borrowing rates – and prepay tat outstanding
                      back home. Nevertheless, do your math before going for a
                      prepayment by borrowing afresh and prepay only if you're
                      making a reasonable saving in interest outgo.
                    </p>
                    <p>3. Explore fixed income options</p>
                    <p>
                      The recent revision in the US Federal Reserve’s interest
                      rates has had their echoes heard across the world,
                      including in the Indian banking system. You can still earn
                      handsome returns (up to 9 per cent per annum) in fixed
                      deposit products with some of India’s public sector banks.
                      Keep in mind, though that the rupee could well depreciate
                      at a similar rate, and you may not ‘earn’ anything on the
                      deposit when compared with keeping your dirham or dollars
                      in a non-interest-paying account.
                    </p>

                    <p>4. Invest in Indian shares</p>
                    <p>
                      Okay, this advice comes with a strong disclaimer – the
                      Indian stock market, like others in the world, is
                      undergoing a correction, and could easily fall another 10
                      to 15 per cent from here on. But as the world renowned
                      investor Warren Buffet once famously remarked – be fearful
                      when others are greedy, and greedy when others are
                      fearful. As markets reach their lows, it may be prudent to
                      keep the cash ready and jump on the bandwagon once they’re
                      on an upswing.
                    </p>
                    <p>5. Buy a house in India</p>
                    <p>
                      Again, do your homework before taking the plunge. Although
                      not to the tune of stock markets, but property prices can
                      and do fluctuate and it is best to study the proposed
                      market’s potential movements before making a huge
                      investment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In the end, what you’d like to do with the extra rupees
                      that your dirham are earning today depends on your
                      individual circumstances and investment objectives, but do
                      remember the golden rule of investment – what goes up,
                      comes down and vice-versa.
                    </p>
