                      Suspects stumbled into victim and held him before fleeing

                      A jobless Ethiopian allegedly caused a pedestrian to take
                      a tumble on a street and snatched Dh50,000 from his pocket
                      before running away, the Dubai Criminal Court heard.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      On September 16 at 12.30pm, Nepali accountant KN, 33, went
                      to a bank and encashed a cheque of Dh20,000 for his
                      employer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “I put Dh150,000 in a bag which I hung on my left shoulder
                      and I put remaining Dh50,000 in my left pocket. I came out
                      of the bank and starting walking towards the company’s
                      office.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      “While walking along Al Musalla Street in Ayal Nasser
                      area, a man stumbled into me and another man held me to
                      prevent me from falling. I felt a hand in my left pocket.
                      I inserted my hand in the pocket and did not find the
                      money. I looked at one of the two men and asked him what
                      he had done.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      “Instantly, he ran away and I ran after him until he got
                      into a building. I waited for him outside for about a
                      minute. When he came out of the building, I ran after him
                      screaming for help from pedestrians. Some people in the
                      street caught and held him until police arrived,” said the
                      victim.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A shop’s CCTV showed the two suspects causing the victim
                      to tumble and fall on the street and snatching his money.
                    </p>

                    <p>NS, 36, admitted to causing the victim to tumble.</p>
                    <p>The court will give its verdict on January 31.</p>
