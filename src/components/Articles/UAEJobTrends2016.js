                    <p>
                      With no more than a fortnight left before we embark upon
                      2016, with it comes a list of New Year’s resolutions with
                      job/career change featuring dominantly on it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      If you are on the lookout to brighten your chances of
                      landing a new job or just want to keep abreast of what’s
                      happening in the job market, here are the 10 trends to
                      watch out for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      According to recruitment firm Hays, these trends are
                      likely to shape the job market, something that candidates
                      should take into account to make their search more
                      effective.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Growth of flexible workforces</h4>
                    <p>
                      This may be good news to many UAE employees. Flexible
                      working hours are very important to those working in the
                      country and a factor that can influence an individual’s
                      decision to stick to a company or not.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A previous Robert Half study indicated that 24 per cent of
                      the people in the country, who participated in the poll,
                      said they may switch jobs if a company offers better and
                      flexible work hours.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Hays, put this as the top trend in the coming year as
                      engaging talent on long-term contracts will become
                      important as organisations seek a flexible headcount.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Organisations will also continue to engage employees on a
                      contract basis with a view to making them permanent if
                      more projects are undertaken.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For candidates this means that being flexible and staying
                      open to both contract and permanent is a must in 2016 if
                      you want to access a greater range of opportunities.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Like-for-like skills and local experience</h4>

                    <p>
                      Local skills and experience have always been very
                      important on a recruiter’s mind but this too is evolving.
                      Hays experts highlight that while doing business in the
                      UAE remains quite different from conducting business in
                      many expat communities, the economy is becoming
                      increasingly globalised.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So, candidates who have both local and international
                      expertise and who are used to working across different
                      cultures, will be at an advantage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For those who lack this, can gain multi-cultural
                      experience to become a preferred candidate of choice. And,
                      candidates who have the right mix will be the favoured
                      ones.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Digital Influencers and analysts</h4>
                    <p>
                      Data analytics has been a big focus in 2015 and this will
                      continue into the New Year as well. Predictions by the
                      recruitment firm show that more organisations will look at
                      this and how they can scale those up into actions. “This
                      is about making data relevant to a business as they
                      continue on the digital transformation journey.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Since this factor will become increasingly important for
                      companies, employees in relevant roles, should look at
                      upskilling to keep with the pace with data trends.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Focus on security</h4>
                    <p>
                      Those in roles such as firewall experts, cyber security
                      specialists and security engineers can expect to see their
                      demand go up as more organisations will be keen to keep
                      their increasing volumes of data safe and prepare for
                      action in the cased of a cyber-attack.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Digital & Mobile Apps</h4>
                    <p>
                      As customers look to transact with companies in more user
                      friendly and simpler ways a higher number of mobile
                      applications are being developed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      And, this will push up the demand for developers in this
                      particular area along with support staff with experience
                      in mobile devices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To keep pace with these technological changes, candidates
                      will need to up their technical skills that is in sync
                      with the company’s brand and values.
                    </p>

                    <h4>DevOps</h4>
                    <p>
                      Dev Ops the short for development and operations – will be
                      another defining trend in the year to come.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As technology becomes important in every aspect of
                      business, more organisations will build and deploy more
                      software more rapidly. This will push further the demand
                      for DevOps professionals, including engineering managers
                      with strong software development and application
                      deployment experience, to upskill or look externally for
                      specialists in application management.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Customer experience</h4>
                    <p>
                      Customer experience will gather more momentum and
                      organisations will use technology in a bigger way to
                      understand customers. For jobseekers, the use of
                      technology in this area will be key. “Showing employers
                      you can design a leading customer experience across all
                      platforms will be critical to secure your next move.”
                    </p>

                    <h4>HR to harness content marketing</h4>
                    <p>
                      Content marketing is being leveraged by companies for
                      recruiting, PR, employee training, and other departments.
                      And, in the coming year, experts at Hays believe that
                      human resources content marketing will be an ongoing trend
                      in 2016.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “Jobseekers should research exactly what their prospective
                      employer is doing by way of utilising technology to create
                      original and engaging HR content. Candidates should also
                      ensure that they showcase examples of where they have done
                      this in past roles in order to demonstrate their
                      suitability for the role and organization,” the report
                      advises.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Workforce diversity</h4>
                    <p>
                      More companies in the UAE will be looking to increase the
                      diversity of their workforce. This is more obvious in the
                      government sector, where efforts are being to push
                      Emiratisation further.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Private sector lags behind and this has resulted in
                      initiatives to upskill nationals from secondary school
                      age, with particular focus on skills akin to working in
                      traditionally male-dominated sectors such as banking &
                      financial services, engineering and technology. Labour
                      forces are likely to consist of an increasing proportion
                      of Emiratis and women in the region, to reflect this
                      change.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Revolution of recruitment outsourcing</h4>
                    <p>
                      Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) comes last on the
                      list of the trends to be seen in 1916 but will experience
                      a revolution as more businesses turn towards it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So, jobseekers in 2016 will notice they may be dealing
                      with partner RPO companies throughout a hiring process,
                      who will introduce them to the employer at a specific
                      stage of the recruitment process, the report says.
                    </p>
