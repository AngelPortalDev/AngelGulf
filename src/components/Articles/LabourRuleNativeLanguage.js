                    <p>New UAE labour rules to be effective from New Year</p>

                    <p>
                      The three new labour rules, effective from the New Year,
                      are in line with the Constitution and International Labour
                      Standards, said Saqr Ghobash, Minister of Labour and
                      Chairman of National Qualifications Authority (NQA).
                    </p>
                    <h4>Labour Contract</h4>

                    <p>
                      The first rule states the employer is obliged to provide
                      foreign workers employment contracts, which details the
                      rights of both the parties in the native language of the
                      recruit. When recruiting people from abroad, the
                      resolution stipulates that the employer must give the new
                      recruit – who is abroad - an offer letter comprising
                      details of the job. As per the Ministry of Labour
                      decision, the offer letter should detail the rights and
                      duties of both the employee and employer. The resolution
                      also emphasises that the employment contract must be
                      offered in the native language of the employee, so as to
                      ensure the person understands the terms mentioned in the
                      contract.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “The work contracts will be in the local language of the
                      worker so they understand all the terms and conditions,”
                      Major-General Obaid Muhari bin Suroor, Deputy
                      Director-General of the Directorate General of Residency
                      and Affairs in Dubai, confirmed to Emirates 24|7. “This
                      will help the worker understand their rights and duties
                      towards their organization,” he added. Also, request for
                      issuing work permits for foreign workers must be
                      accompanied by the employment contract that is duly signed
                      by both the parties.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Only, if both the employer and the employee have signed
                      the contract will it be officially registered with the
                      Ministry as a legal contract. And once the contract is
                      registered, amendments can be made only with the consent
                      of both the parties and after the Ministry approval. These
                      rules also apply to people recruited from within the UAE.
                      Ghobash put the resolutions recently to over 300 ministry
                      employees and legal scholars to review and provide
                      feedback.
