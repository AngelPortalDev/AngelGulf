                      Effective January 2016, there will be no six months ban if
                      services are terminated in mutual agreement between the
                      employer and employee, Arabic daily Al Bayan reported.
                      ALSO READ: Employment contract must be in native language.
                      UAE Ministry of Labour has confirmed that the ban of six
                      months will be cancelled beginning January if the work
                      permit and employment are terminated in mutual agreement.
                      According to the Ministry, employees will be allowed new
                      work permits to join another facility immediately, even if
                      the employee has not completed two years at the first
                      facility. However, the Ministry confirmed that workers
                      under level IV and V who have not completed six months
                      with the first establishment will be excluded from this
                      rule.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The new rule is part of the new resolutions issued by
                      Labour Minister Saqr Ghobash in September and which will
                      be effective in January. The ministry has completed
                      procedures for implementation of the resolutions beginning
                      next year, the report added. Humaid Rashid bin Dimas Al
                      Suwaidi, Assistant Undersecretary at Ministry of Labour,
                      told Al Bayan that under the new resolution, employees who
                      end their service in agreement with the establishments and
                      cancel their work permits will be allowed to move to other
                      establishments, even if they have not completed two years
                      at the workplace. However, workers in levels IV and V who
                      have not completed six months with the first facility are
                      exempted from this rule, he added.

                    <h4>Attracting talents</h4>
                    <p>
                      Al Suwaidi confirmed that the new Ministry rule aims to
                      attract and retain talent, and is in line with the
                      strategic goal of the government to being a
                      knowledge-based economy attracting global talent. He said
                      the ministry aims to promote workers from within the
                      country rather than bringing them from abroad, especially
                      people with expertise. Al Suwaidi said last year 340,000
                      workers who ended their service at one job could not get
                      new work permits because they had not completed two years
                      and the labour market thus could not benefit from
                      experiences and skills.
