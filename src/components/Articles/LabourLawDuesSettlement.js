                      Ruling based on the contract signed by employer and
                      employee
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The Dubai Court of Cassation issued a verdict in favour of
                      an engineer and compelled a company to pay him Dh 26,700
                      after he had worked for only four months in the company.
                      The court based its ruling on the contract signed between
                      the employee and the company and its terms, which
                      stipulated that the probationary period was for three
                      months. The Court also based its ruling on the text of
                      article 37 of the labour code, which prohibits putting the
                      worker in probation more than once.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Earlier, the employee had filed a lawsuit against the
                      company he was working for and he claimed that the company
                      should pay him Dh 33,000 as payment for working for four
                      months. He said in his suit that he joined the company as
                      the Director of Projects with a monthly salary of Dh 4,500
                      in addition to a housing allowance of Dh 2,500. The
                      company ended his services after four months. The Court of
                      First Instance issued a judgment in favour of the employee
                      and forced the company to pay him Dh 26,700 as his dues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The company did not accept this ruling and approached the
                      Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeals ruled in favour of
                      the company. The employee challenged his former employer
                      before the Supreme Court. The Court noted in its judgment
                      the company's disregard of labour contract in enforcing a
                      6-month probation period. The Court also said that it
                      would take the appointment letter, which stated that the
                      trial period is three months. The Court praised the UAE
                      labour law and said that the legislature grants the
                      employer the right to end the services of the worker
                      during the period of probation without notice or
                      end-of-service gratuity.
