                      More than 60% of UAE employers are definitely hiring
                      employers in the next three months
                    </p>

                      Abu Dhabi: With the UAE being more attractive as a job
                      market than any other country in the region, more than 60
                      per cent of UAE employers are definitely hiring employees
                      in the next three months, a representative of a leading
                      recruitment portal told Gulf News in the capital on
                      Thursday. “UAE hosts a mix of expatriate and local
                      talents. Due to this, it becomes important to know which
                      relevant skills, experience and qualification employers
                      are specifically looking for,” Suhail Masri,
                      vice-president of sales at Bayt.com, said. Several fields
                      of employment are rising now in Dubai. “Nearly 66 per cent
                      of UAE companies have hired new employees in the last six
                      months, compared to 63 per cent around the Middle East and
                      North Africa (Mena) region who have done so,” he added.

                      What do UAE employers look for in new hires?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                      “Our latest research, the Bayt.com Mena Job Index Survey,
                      which was conducted in July 2014, reveals the skills
                      sought after by employers in potential new hires,” he
                      said. According to the survey, employers in the UAE are
                      looking for candidates who have good communication skills
                      in Arabic and English (60 per cent), who are team players
                      (50 per cent), have good leadership skills (45 per cent),
                      and good negotiation skills (45 per cent). “In terms of
                      experience, employers in the UAE mostly look out for
                      candidates who have the ability to manage a team, who have
                      worked in sales and marketing or in administration.
                      Keeping this in mind, jobseekers must work on the relevant
                      skills and experience,” he added.

                      “In fact 67 per cent of companies are definitely hiring in
                      the next three months. Nearly 74 per cent claim they will
                      either ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ be hiring, in a year’s
                      time. Interestingly, 21 per cent of companies will look to
                      fill up to between six to ten positions, most of which, 36
                      per cent, will be for junior executive roles. According to
                      the Bayt.com Modern Job Research in the Mena poll, which
                      was conducted in November 2013, around 41 per cent of
                      employers always research candidates online at first. “It
                      is a perfect time for jobseekers to get online and get
                      noticed by employers,” Masri said. Construction, banking
                      and finance, oil, gas and petrochemicals are the fields
                      that require employees currently.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      “When it comes to fields that require employees currently,
                      UAE respondents believe that industries which are most
                      attractive as well as retain the top talent are
                      construction (39 per cent) and banking and finance (39 per
                      cent), followed by oil, gas, and petrochemicals (35 per
                      cent),” he said. “However, in the next three months, UAE
                      companies will seek sales managers (19 per cent), customer
                      service representatives (15 per cent), human resources
                      professionals (14 per cent), project managers (14 per
                      cent), and executive assistants (14 per cent),” he added.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Business management and engineering are the top list
                      qualification of candidates. “The most sought after
                      qualification among candidates in the Mena region is
                      business management at graduate or postgraduate level. In
                      the UAE, the most desirable qualification is one in
                      engineering, followed by business management and commerce.
                      As the UAE has developed a gamut of higher education
                      institutions, jobseekers can easily choose to pursue these
                      qualifications,” Masri said.
