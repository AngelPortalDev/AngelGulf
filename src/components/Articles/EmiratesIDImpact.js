                      Banks, telecom firms need you to submit Emirates ID and
                      work visa upon renewal
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Remember, once you get your work visa and Emirates ID card
                      renewed; submit copies to your bank and telecom companies.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Non-submission can result in freezing of your bank account
                      and disconnection of your phone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “Your Emirates ID is expiring, please submit the renewed
                      Emirates ID at the base branch or else your account will
                      be frozen within 30 days,” reads the bank message sent to
                      R Ahmed (name changed), whose work visa expired on January
                      12, 2016.

                    <p>
                      Emirates ID renewal is, in fact, related to the work visa
                      renewal, which simply means that if a work visa is not
                      renewed, the person’s Emirates ID will not be renewed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Ahmed says his bank was reminding him at least 15 days
                      prior to the expiry of his Emirates ID
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “The bank has been sending me reminders to update my
                      information.”

                    <p>
                      He said that he was denied a cash withdrawal from his bank
                      once his Emirates ID had expired.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “The cashier asked me for my passport, but it was with my
                      company for renewal of my work visa. Hence, I could not
                      remove cash the required cash.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Apart from his banks, he has also got an SMS from his
                      telecom company.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “I have even got an SMS from one of the telecom companies

                      Emirates Identity Authority said this week that the
                      Emirates ID number issued for each individual, whether a
                      citizen or resident, is registered in the population
                      register system and is fixed and may not be modified or
                      changed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In December 2015, Emirates 24|7 reported that the UAE
                      banks were advising customers to complete the ‘Know Your
                      Customer’ (KYC) requirement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If not, customers could find their cheque clearance
                      facilities blocked.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This is not related to any visa renewal issue, but a
                      general update by banks for their customers.
