                                            In a major step toward modernising the labour market, the Saudi Arabian government has introduced bold reforms to its iconic Iqama or residence permit system. The new <a href="https://www.hrsd.gov.sa/sites/default/files/2025-07/guidelines-for-classification-of-work-permits-by-skill-categories---updated-version---28-may-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary">Saudi Arabia Skill-Based Work Permit System</a>, developed by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development (MHRSD), moves the Kingdom toward a merit-driven, digital platform that rewards genuine talent and experience.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            For millions of Indian professionals and other foreign workers seeking Gulf job opportunities through overseas Gulf job consultants like Angel Gulf Jobs, this policy is a game-changer. It is offering greater career mobility, fairer wages, and a transparent, skills-based path to success.
                                        </p>

                                        <h2 className="h4 mt-4 mb-3">What is an Iqama in Saudi Arabia?</h2>
                                        <p>
                                            An Iqama is the official residence permit issued by the Saudi Arabian government to expats working or living in the Kingdom. It is your primary identity document in Saudi Arabia and is required for almost everything. It is required for opening a bank account and signing a rental contract, entering government offices and even getting a Saudi SIM card.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            To work legally in Saudi Arabia, you must have a local sponsor (employer), and the Iqama acts as proof that you are officially employed or living in the country with your family.
                                        </p>

                                        <h2 className="h4 mt-4 mb-3">Part of Saudi Vision 2030</h2>
                                        <p>
                                            As part of <a href="https://www.vision2030.gov.sa/media/rc0b5oy1/saudi_vision203.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary">Saudi Vision 2030</a>, which aims to diversify the economy and attract global talent, the MHRSD will re-classify more than 13 million expatriates into three skill levels: High-Skilled, Skilled, and Basic. This system operates through the upgraded Qiwa platform, the central digital platform for managing employment services in the Kingdom.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The new classification system prioritises education, experience, and earning potential over outdated sponsorship ties. For Indian job seekers, who make up nearly 2.6 million workers in Saudi Arabia, this means smoother job transfers, longer residency, and access to high-tier work permits with better benefits.
                                        </p>

                                        <h2 className="h4 mt-4 mb-3">Saudi Iqama reforms: Skill-Based Work Permit Classification System explained</h2>
                                        <p>
                                            The Saudi Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development designed the new classification system to organise all work permits by skill level instead of job title or sponsorship. Work permits now fall into three main categories: High-Skilled, Skilled, and Basic.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            This reform improves labour-market efficiency, supports local upskilling, and ensures that professional expertise is recognised and rewarded. The system is based on the <a href="https://www.stats.gov.sa/en/w/saudi-standard-classification-of-occupations?id=2813173" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary">Saudi Standard Classification of Occupations (SSCO)</a>, a national framework that groups jobs into nine categories, from managers to service workers. Each job is evaluated on the basis of education, experience, wages, and professional certification, ensuring fair recognition across all occupations.
                                        </p>

                                        <h2 className="h4 mt-4 mb-3">Implementation Timeline and Process</h2>
                                        <p>
                                            The rollout of the new Skill-Based Work Permit Classification System is taking place in two stages.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Phase 1 began on 5 July 2025, covering existing foreign workers already in Saudi Arabia. Their permits are being reviewed and re-classified according to the new skill levels.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Phase 2 started shortly after and applies to new workers entering the Kingdom for employment. Employers submit data via the Qiwa platform, and classifications appear automatically. If rules are misapplied, correction requests can be submitted.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Employers must update employee data on the Qiwa platform. This platform is the HRSD's digital platform to ensure that each worker's category is accurate. If a classification is found to be incorrect, both employers and employees can request a correction through the same system, provided they meet the official criteria of the Saudi Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development.
                                        </p>

                                        <h2 className="h4 mt-4 mb-3">Impact on Indian Job Seekers</h2>
                                        <p>
                                            For India's Gulf-bound workforce, the Saudi Arabia Skill-Based Work Permit System offers new opportunities but also higher expectations.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Highly qualified Indian professionals, such as engineers, IT specialists, healthcare experts, and technicians, can now access top-tier permits with better pay and long-term benefits. Early MHRSD data suggests that salaries for high-skilled categories could rise by 20–30 percent.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Meanwhile, Saudi Vision 2030 industries such as renewables, fintech, and advanced manufacturing have already reported a 15 percent increase in high-skilled work permit approvals.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            However, for Basic workers such as drivers or labourers, stricter rules on education, age, and wages could reduce new job entries by 10–15 percent. The system's reliance on the Qiwa digital platform also requires a level of digital literacy, which may challenge applicants from rural or less tech-enabled backgrounds.
                                        </p>

                                        <h2 className="h4 mt-4 mb-3">Conclusion</h2>
                                        <p>
                                            Therefore, Saudi Arabia's Iqama Reforms 2025 mark the beginning of a fair, skill-driven employment system under the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development. From August 3, all new long-term employment visas linked to Iqama in Saudi Arabia must fall under one of the three skill categories—High-Skilled, Skilled, or Basic. This reform is a significant step toward a transparent, merit-based labour market.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            For Indian workers, this means better recognition, higher earning potential, and new paths to growth in the evolving Gulf job ecosystem.
