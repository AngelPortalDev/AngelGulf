                                            A new <a href="https://www.ilo.org/media/441711/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">labour migration report</a> shows that Indian blue-collar workers continue to dominate jobs in Gulf region. Saudi Arabia has emerged as the top destination for blue-collar workers seeking jobs in Gulf.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Between January 2020 and June 2025, more than 1.6 million Indian workers under the Emigration Check Required (ECR) category migrated to 14 countries. Out of this total, Saudi Arabia alone hired 695,269 Indian workers, making it the leading overseas destination for blue-collar employment and jobs in Gulf.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            This growing demand highlights the importance of trusted overseas job consultants such as Angel Gulf Jobs, one of India's leading overseas job consultants and manpower consultancies.

                                            Saudi Arabia: The No. 1 Destination for Indian Workers for Jobs in Saudi Arabia
                                        </h2>
                                        <p>
                                            According to official migration statistics, Saudi Arabia has consistently remained the most preferred and most active destination for Indian blue-collar roles for jobs in Saudi Arabia. The country's ongoing megaprojects under Saudi Vision 2030, such as NEOM, The Line, and large-scale urban development projects, have significantly increased demand for Indian technicians, labourers, drivers, construction workers, electricians, plumbers, and other jobs in Saudi Arabia.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            As Gulf countries continue to expand their construction and service sectors, the demand for jobs in Gulf for Indian manpower is expected to remain stable in the coming years.

                                        <p>
                                            Below are several factors that will explain to you why GCC countries continue to hire Indian job seekers in large numbers.
                                        </p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                Indian blue-collar workers bring strong technical and trade skills. They work confidently in construction, electrical, mechanical, fabrication, and other essential trades that Gulf projects depend on.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Employers in the Gulf value Indian blue-collar workers for their reliability and productivity. They consistently deliver disciplined work, follow site rules, and maintain a strong work ethic.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Many Indian blue-collar workers also have basic English communication skills. This helps them understand instructions, improves coordination on worksites, and supports better safety practices.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Indian blue-collar workers adapt easily to multicultural work sites. They integrate quickly with diverse labour teams and perform well in demanding Gulf work environments.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Finally, GCC employers trust regulated recruitment channels. They prefer hiring Indian blue-collar workers through authorised systems that provide verified, trained, and job-ready candidates.
                                            </li>
