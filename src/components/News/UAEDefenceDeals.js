                      The UAE today signed six deals worth more than Dh767
                      million with various international and local companies to
                      help strengthen the country’s unmanned and aerospace
                      defence sector. The announcement was made at a press
                      conference by Brigadier General Rashid Mohammed Al-Shamsi,
                      Chairman of Higher Organising Committee of the second
                      Unmanned System Exhibition (UMEX 2016) and the pilot
                      edition of the Simulation Conference and Exhibition 2016.
                      Quebec Simulation Systems won a deal to install internal
                      training systems consisting of 20 shooting systems Dh9.107
                      million, said Al-Shamsi.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Other major deals went to CIA Inc. for the sale of Dh404.8
                      million simulation systems and the International Flight
                      Academy to train pilots on Blackhawks aircraft worth
                      Dh80.377 million. Infox Simulation signed a deal worth
                      Dh160 million whereas the local player Al Badi won Dh50
                      million contract to train technicians and operators from
                      Republic of Belarus on Volate tanks. It was also announced
                      that Abu Dhabi Autonomous Systems Investments (ADASI) won
                      an Dh62.888 deal to supply spare parts for Sebar project.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Brigadier General Al-Shamsi said that the decision to
                      separate UMEX exhibition from IDEX was made by His
                      Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince
                      of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed
                      Forces, for the vital importance that the unmanned sector
                      plays, especially in modern warfare. "All operations
                      around the world now involve unmanned drones flying
                      somewhere which gives support and enables officials to
                      make better and more precise decisions," he said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Al-Shamsi added that UMEX has been a very successful
                      decision and size-wise grew 600% since 2015, when it was
                      still part of IDEX. "We expect more growth for 2018 and we
                      hope to attract even more companies in the sector which
                      also include those that produce sensor equipment like
                      radars, cameras, lasers and all those things required in
                      the manufacturing of unmanned equipment," he said. The
                      chairman stressed the importance of unmanned for UAE’s
                      vison saying that they will always be considering to get
                      more local companies involved in growing and strengthening
                      the sector. "This technology is very important to acquire,
                      and to have the capability to do it yourself is a
                      strategic goal we are trying to reach," he said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      "The UAE companies we are seeing like ADASI are part of
                      Abu Dhabi’s vision towards aerospace manufacturing. These
                      companies are part of the leadership’s direction to
                      upgrade the level of manufacturing in the country and to
                      become a hub for the industry in the region," he added.
