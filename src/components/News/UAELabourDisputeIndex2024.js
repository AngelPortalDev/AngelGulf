                      According to the 2024 International Institute for Management Development (IMD) World Competitiveness Yearbook, the <a href="https://mohre.gov.ae/en/media-center/news/12/5/2023/uae-tops-the-world-in-5-labour-market-competitiveness-indices-reinforces-its-global-leadership" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary">UAE ranks first </a>globally for the lowest labour dispute rate, reaffirming its position as a world leader in employment stability and worker protection. As Angel Gulf Jobs is a trusted overseas Gulf job consultancy, we closely monitor these developments because they directly impact the safety, stability, and long-term growth opportunities available to Indian professionals seeking jobs in UAE and jobs in Gulf.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The Global Labour Dispute Index is part of the IMD study, which measures how effectively countries manage workplace conflicts, focusing on fairness, dispute resolution speed, and employee rights protection. The UAE’s top ranking reflects a transparent, balanced, and efficient labour system admired worldwide.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This success results from ongoing MoHRE labour reforms under the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE). These reforms have strengthened the UAE’s labour market by balancing employer and employee needs, promoting productivity and ensuring fair employment practices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The report shows that the UAE records only 3 labour complaints per 100 workers, the lowest rate in the world. In 2024, MoHRE resolved 98% of all complaints, most through quick and amicable settlements, easing pressure on the courts and improving labour market efficiency.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      These outcomes stem from Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021, which modernised UAE labour laws 2024, covering working hours, remote work policies, annual leave, and employee protection measures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This milestone reinforces the UAE’s global reputation as a model for employment stability, economic competitiveness, and fair labour governance. It is a major advantage for job seekers and employers connected through Angel Gulf Jobs, a manpower consultancy for Gulf jobs. We help Indian job seekers access safe, compliant, and rewarding career opportunities in the UAE.

                    <h2 className="h4 mt-4 mb-3">Factors Behind UAE's Top Ranking</h2>
                    <p>
                      The UAE's global success comes from targeted reforms and efficient systems introduced by the MoHRE, making it one of the world’s most advanced labour markets.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Streamlined Complaint Process:</strong> Under Federal Decree Law No. 33, MoHRE can now make final decisions on labour disputes worth up to AED 50,000, or if no appeal is filed within 15 days. Larger labour disputes go directly to labour courts, ensuring faster resolutions and fewer delays.</li>
                        <li><strong>Focus on Amicable Resolutions of Labour Disputes:</strong> MoHRE’s specialised legal mediators handle labour disputes confidentially and fairly, encouraging out-of-court settlements. This builds trust and harmony between employers and employees.</li>
                        <li><strong>Low Dispute Rates:</strong> The UAE’s job market has one of the lowest labour dispute rates in the world. Strict contract enforcement, timely wage payments, and employer compliance help maintain worker confidence and business integrity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Broader Competitiveness Gains:</strong> Beyond labour stability, the UAE also ranked high in five other IMD labour market indicators in 2024. It includes talent attraction, workforce adaptability, and low unemployment rates. These achievements reflect the UAE’s regulatory excellence and economic growth.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 className="h4 mt-4 mb-3">Impact on Indian Overseas Workers in UAE</h2>
                    <p>
                      The UAE government's leadership in the Global Labour Dispute Index 2024 directly benefits Indian overseas workers, who make up a large part of the expatriate workforce.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Faster and Fairer Dispute Resolution:</strong> New rules from Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021 help Indian workers. They now get quick, clear, and fair handling of labour disputes. Their rights and protections are upheld.</li>
                        <li><strong>Greater Job Mobility:</strong> Under the new UAE labour law 2024, employees can change jobs freely without the employer's consent. This reform enhances career growth, job satisfaction, and employee freedom.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stronger Worker Protections:</strong> MoHRE has introduced worker-friendly initiatives, including bans on outdoor work during extreme heat, mandatory health insurance, and remote work options. These steps help create a safer and flexible work environment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Steady Remittance Growth:</strong> Improved job stability and fair labour dispute handling help Indian workers maintain steady employment. This results in an expected 5–10% annual increase in remittances to India, benefiting families and strengthening India’s economy.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 className="h4 mt-4 mb-3">A New Chapter in Labour Relations</h2>
                    <p>
                      The UAE’s first-place ranking in the Global Labour Dispute Index 2024 marks a transformative shift in global labour standards. Guided by Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021, the UAE continues to advance worker protections, enhance employer–employee relations, and ensure sustainable growth and UAE employer stability in its labour market.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For Indian overseas workers, this represents a future of safer, fairer, and more rewarding opportunities in one of the world’s most dynamic and stable economies.
