                      Group under its umbrella, will hire approximately another
                      2,500 employees this year as it aims to open 25 new

                      looking about 25 openings this year in the Gulf region,
                      most of them in Saudi Arabia, Oman and Kuwait. Next year
                      more openings will be in Qatar. We are involved in most of
                      key developments (shopping malls) in GCC where Centrepoint

                      have got a lot of store openings in May and June –
                      particularly in Saudi Arabia,” Cooper told Emirates 24l7

                      Collection. Out of 128 existing outlets, the group
                      operates half of stores as standalone and others within
                      shopping malls. In Dubai, it’s operating in shopping malls
