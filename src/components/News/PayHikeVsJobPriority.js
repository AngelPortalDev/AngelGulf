                      Companies in the UAE may not necessarily open up their
                      purse-strings and offer a fatter pay cheque to employees
                      this year. The latest salary guide from professional
                      services recruiter Morgan McKinley indicates a scenario
                      where salaries are expected to remain broadly flat in
                      2016. Until the very end of 2015, the recruitment firm has
                      predicted a bumper year in 2016, in terms of both the
                      creation of new jobs as well as salary growth, but it has
                      now revised those expectations downward. This, of course,
                      isn’t great news for employees and candidates.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      As per the recruiter’s predictions, salary growth is
                      expected to drop below current levels or to remain flat
                      for the year ahead. “We are predicting that, for the full
                      year of 2016, salary [hikes] could drop to as low at 2 or
                      3 per cent below certain levels or remain relatively flat
                      depending on commodity prices,” the salary guide states.
                      The report also highlights that instead of looking at
                      bigger payouts this year, employees should be more
                      concerned about remaining employed. “There are significant
                      divergences around this forecast with some sectors likely
                      to perform better than others, leading to respective
                      salary growth. We are hopeful that salaries will increase
                      above 2015 levels in the second half of 2016, but this
                      will largely depend on what happens to oil prices as the
                      year progresses,” reads the report.

                    <p>
                      According to Mercer Middle East’s 2015 Total Remuneration
                      Survey, released in January, salary increase forecasts for
                      2016 in the UAE and Qatar are now recorded at 4.9 per cent
                      – a figure below five per cent for the first time in five
                      years. Some recruitment companies in the country had taken
                      a similar cautious outlook, estimating that pay hikes in
                      store for UAE employees will be well below the five per
                      cent-mark. Towers Watson’s salary budget planning report
                      maintains that UAE and GCC employees are set to get a pay
                      rise of an average 4.8 per cent in 2016. This marks a
                      return to 2014, when pay hikes were the same and is
                      expected to be marginally lower than 2015.

                    <p>
                      Consultancy Aon Hewitt, however, maintains that UAE firms
                      project a 5 per cent increase in pay in 2016, up from the
                      4.8 per cent projection made for 2015. In terms of actual
                      increases for 2015, the UAE recorded a 4.8 per cent
                      increase.
