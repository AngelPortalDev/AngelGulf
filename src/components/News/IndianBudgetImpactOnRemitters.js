                      Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley presented a balanced
                      budget on Monday, February 29, 2016, and the rupee has
                      been on steroids ever since. The rupee continued its
                      unabashed rise over all six sessions since the country's
                      Budget 2016 was presented on the last day of February,
                      staging a euphoric comeback to mark the currency's biggest
                      weekly gains since September 2013. Several expats who were
                      waiting for their February salaries to remit at the ‘best
                      ever’ exchange rate were disappointed as the rupee began
                      an incredible rally just before they could actually remit.
                      The proverbial tide in the sentiment towards India as an
                      investment destination and the Indian rupee seems to be
                      turning for the better, with the rupee and equities
                      emerging as the biggest beneficiaries of the post-budget
                      week (see chart below).

                    <p>
                      The rupee rose 2.9 per cent in a week, from near an
                      all-time low of Rs68.899 vs $1 [Rs18.758 vs Dh1] on
                      Thursday, February 25, 2016, to Rs66.885 vs $1 [Rs18.209
                      vs Dh1] on Friday, March 4, 2016. The benchmark Bombay
                      Stock Exchange Sensitivity Index (BSE Sensex) was trading
                      at 22,778 points when Jaitley was about half-an-hour into
                      his 90-minute budget speech. The BSE Sensex index closed
                      the week at 24,646 points, up 1,868 points – or 8.2 per
                      cent – in five days. That’s the best post-budget week that
                      the index has seen in a decade.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The week gone by saw the rupee appreciate the most since
                      it rose more than 7 per cent in the eight days between
                      September 3 – 11, 2013, the week India’s rockstar central
                      bank governor Raghuram Govind Rajan took the helm at
                      Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Euphoria surrounding Rajan’s
                      RBI takeover was in anticipation of the end of India’s
                      ‘policy paralysis’ – a phrase that described the
                      government’s inaction on various matters during Manmohan
                      Singh’s second five-year term as Prime Minister. This
                      time, though, it is in response to the measures announced
                      in the budget. Jaitley announced increased spending on
                      rural jobs programme, set aside money for higher
                      government salaries and pensions, and announced a new
                      health insurance plan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      He also reiterated of the Indian government’s seriousness
                      about reigning in the country’s fiscal deficit to a
                      nine-year-low of 3.5 per cent of GDP in the forthcoming
                      fiscal year. These, along with other measures he
                      announced, did the trick and encouraged foreign investors
                      to make a euphoric comeback into Indian equities, pushing
                      the currency higher. And while the rupee’s gain is expats’
                      loss (because they will have to spend more in the currency
                      they earn to remit the same amount of rupees), not many
                      are complaining. Even after the recent gains, the rupee is
                      only at a two-and-a-half-month high, and is trading at
                      mid-January, 2016, levels. Over the last one year, though,
                      the rupee is still down more than 8 per cent over the
                      highs achieved in early April 2015.
