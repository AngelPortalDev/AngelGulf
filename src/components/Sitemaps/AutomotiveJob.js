                      GCC is the biggest economic block in the entire Middle
                      East region. The countries in the GCC region have seen
                      tremendous growth in both passenger as well as commercial
                      vehicle segments throughout the beginning of the century &
                      till date. The countries in the GCC region have achieved
                      double digit sales growth year-on-year basis. The light
                      weight segment itself in the Gulf region has witnessed
                      strong growth of over 20% in 2012 to touch around 1.5
                      million units. The industry is expected to continue this
                      upward trend, although at a slower pace, over the medium
                      term. The demand has risen across all the automotive
                      sectors including luxury cars and commercial sector result
                      into massive rise in automotive jobs / automobile jobs in

                    Most Gulf countries reported a surge in overall passenger
                    car sales, which act as an important indicator of business
                    activity, reflecting the regionâ€™s consumer spending boom.
                    Rapid industrialization, migration of people from all over
                    the world in the Gulf region for jobs & business and
                    increased government spending are the main reasons for the
                    growth in the automotive sector. The demand in passenger car
                    sales is also coming from consumer with high disposal income
                    looking for replacement of their cars into a new or luxury
                    model, the large affluent expatriate population and
                    ultra-low subsidized petrol prices are also the contributing
                    factors. The demand is expected to grow consistently
                    throughout the GCC region in coming years too.

                    The growth of Automotive industry throughout the Gulf region
                    (GCC region) has resulted into a huge demand for
                    engineering, technical & other support workforce across
                    different automotive factories that have been setup
                    throughout the region. Continuous supply of technical &
                    non-technical work force to fit into various automotive /
                    automobile job functions is required by these factories to
                    meet the growing demand. Any time lag between the demand for
                    workers and their supply would create an adverse effect on
                    the entire automotive industry including the GCC economy. It
                    is of utmost importance that the industry keeps getting
                    regular supply of workforce at all the levels as per the
                    desired traits and above all at the right time.
