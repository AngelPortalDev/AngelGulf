                    </h4>
                    <p>
                      According to different reports published on the Middle
                      East Manned Security Services market, the industry
                      expected growth is CAGR 7.78% for the period (2022-27).
                      Manned security services mean the employment of guards and
                      security workers trained for doing specific jobs like the
                      security of people, property, and assets, discouraging
                      crime and averting assault, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Many factors are responsible for the demand surge in the
                      industry. They are
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The Middle East countries have experienced significant
                      growth in recent times, which has improved the living
                      conditions of individuals. It has also increased the
                      incidences such as abduction, cross-border crime,
                      burglaries, etc. All these have raised the need for human
                      protection and security guard jobs in the Gulf region.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                  <p className="mt-2">
                    The technology inclusion in residential and commercial
                    places has increased the demand for new skilled security
                    staff (People who can learn and start working with the
                    technology faster).
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Another factor that influences the increase in the demand
                    for manned Guard security services is group housing, such as
                    residential and commercial places. During the projection
                    period, these places require manned security in a large
                    numbers. Later the requirement decreases but continues as
                    the residents of society hire private guards for societyâ€™s
                    safety.

                  <p>
                    The COVID-19 Pandemic adversely impacted the security market
                    during the lockdown period. It reduced the demand for
                    security jobs in the market. However, things have changed,
                    and the market is now open. Now, there is a surge in the
                    security staff demand for security guards and security
                    officers jobs.
