                    <p>
                      Gulf countries have achieved remarkable economic growth
                      since the start of the century. GCC economies have grown
                      five-fold to reach $1.6 trillion over the past 15 years,
                      while the population has risen nearly 80 per cent due to
                      rapid domestic population expansion and influx of
                      expatriates. The remarkable growth has made huge demands
                      on infrastructure from roads to rail, healthcare services
                      to education, with virtually every segment of the
                      supporting industries being stretched to their limits
                      including power and energy sector. This has resulted into
                      generation of huge number of power & energy plant jobs
                      attracting masses from different parts of the world. Truly
                      speaking, power is one of the core sectors of any economy
                      and is the major driving force behind industrialization
                      and infrastructure development. Lack of ample power
                      generation and related facilities cause not only
                      inconvenience, but also economic loss due to reduced
                      industrial production. The smooth functioning of the above
                      sectors and continuous economic growth can be achieved if
                      and only if power is generated in ample and is managed
                      professionally.

                    The tremendous growth seen in the industry has resulted into

                    industry requirements. Any hiccup in the regular and timely
