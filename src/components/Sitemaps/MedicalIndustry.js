                    With increasing population in the GCC states, spending in private and public hospitals in the UAE will hit $12.5 billion in 2020, the second highest in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, according to consultants. As per the estimates from the Ministry of Health data in 2012, the market size for health care delivery services in the GCC will jump from $37 billion in 2012 to $56 billion in about six years. The health care market in Saudi Arabia will remain the biggest at $28.7 billion by 2020, while Kuwaitâ€™s inpatient and outpatient treatment expenditures ($6.9 billion) will be the third highest in the region, followed by Oman ($3.8 billion) and Qatar (2.7 billion).

                  </div>
                  <p className="mt-2">
                  The ever increasing pressure on the healthcare industry in GCC states is generating tremendous demand for qualified doctors, nurses & other medical staff. The sourcing that has been done from the local market proves to be insufficient and the demand has been met usually through countries like India, Pakistan, UK & so on. The hospitals & medical centres are more concerned about the quality of the staff and are very generous in providing the best of salary packages, accommodation and other facilities. There are many agencies helping to bridge this gap however not all are well equipped to handle the requirements from the healthcare industry effectively.

                  The ever increasing pressure on the healthcare industry in GCC states is generating tremendous demand for qualified doctors, nurses & other medical staff. The sourcing that has been done from the local market proves to be insufficient and the demand has been met usually through countries like India, Pakistan, UK & so on. The hospitals & medical centres are more concerned about the quality of the staff and are very generous in providing the best of salary packages, accommodation and other facilities. There are many agencies helping to bridge this gap however not all are well equipped to handle the requirements from the healthcare industry effectively.
