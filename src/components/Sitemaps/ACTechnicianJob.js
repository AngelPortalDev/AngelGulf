                    <p>
                      GCC states are growing at a very fast pace achieving more
                      than double digit growth year-on-year basis. This has
                      resulted into huge demand for construction across
                      industrial, commercial & residential sectors. In todayâ€™s
                      world air-conditioning system is no luxury; however, it
                      has become a necessity. The air-conditioning industry is
                      not a main stream industry as like oil & gas, civil
                      industry & so on; however, it is growing parallel along
                      with these main stream industries resulting into a large
                      number of air-conditioning / HVAC jobs year on year basis.
                      The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)
                      market in the GCC is forecast to grow at a compound annual
                      rate of 7.43 per cent in the coming years and the key
                      factor for this growth is the upturn in construction
                      activity. In the year 2015, the HVAC market in the GCC was
                      worth about $3 billion (about Dh11 billion). More than
                      half of this constituted the residential market, with the
                      rest making up commercial air conditioning. The UAE market
                      alone stood at around $850 million and is forecast to
                      cross the $1-billion mark in 2018.{" "}
