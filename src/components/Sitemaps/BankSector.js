                      Gulf Countries are expanding at a significant pace in
                      every sphere of business. They are no more over-reliant on
                      their traditional petroleum and gas export business.
                      During the 1970s and early 1980s, the countries in Gulf
                      made significant progress in the modernization of
                      financial infrastructure and its penetration. The
                      countries are further intensifying their growth in the
                      sectors with the aim to diversify their economy. The move
                      is creating plenty of jobs in the <strong> bank and finance sector </strong>
                      in Gulf countries.

                  Abundant oil revenues in the region led to a sizable accumulation of private wealth and foreign assets. However, the banking and finance sectors leapt only in the early 1990s. It faced a slowdown in between due to the change in external factors; however, the entire industry is buoyant after COVID-19, and it is welcoming resources from all over the world.
