                  <p>Dubai is one of the most sought-after work destinations for Indians because of the easy availability of jobs, work culture, international work environment, great perks, etc. However, finding jobs in UAE is no easier than in any Western country. There is tough competition along with strict labour law (to protect immigrantsâ€™ work rights in UAE.)</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, the authorities in UAE are promoting nationalization at workplaces making finding jobs a bit more time taking; nevertheless, there is always a demand for skilled and experienced professionals in UAE. The country welcomes foreign workers for different work profiles in a large number. They primarily hire people through online job portals or consultants.</p>
                  <p>So, if you are aspiring to work in UAE, use both mediums to find openings. There are many consultants present that render finding <strong>jobs in UAE for Indian</strong> aspirants easy. Angel Gulf Jobs is one among many.

                  <p>Out of about 3.4 million expatriates in UAE, 30% population is Indian. This makes referencing and finding <strong>jobs in UAE</strong> a little easier for Indian aspirants.</p>
