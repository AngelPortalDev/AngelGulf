          Saudi Arabia’s Professional Accreditation Programme (PAP), also known as Takamol or Skills Verification Programme, is a mandatory trade testing program for specific blue-collar and skilled technical workers travelling to the Kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine hiring someone for a crucial technical role, only to find out later that they don’t truly know the job. To eliminate this problem, Saudi Arabia rolled out the Skill Verification Program (SVP) as part of Saudi Vision 2030. This Skill Verification Program ensures only genuinely skilled workers enter key industries in Saudi Arabia through overseas job consultants like Angel Gulf Jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re an Indian skilled professional planning to work in Saudi Arabia, the SVP test India process, also known as Saudi professional verification India, is now mandatory. At Angel Gulf Jobs Saudi recruitment, we guide thousands of Indian workers every year in completing their SVP process smoothly, ensuring your skills are recognised, and your visa progresses without delays.
        </p>

      <section className="blog-section mb-5">
        <h2 className="h3 fw-bold section-title-blue">What Is the Skill Verification Programme (SVP)?</h2>
        <p>
          The Saudi Skill Verification Programme is a mandatory skill assessment system introduced by Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Human Resources & Social Development (MHRSD). It ensures that foreign workers possess the technical skills required for their professions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The programme, also called “Professional Verification” / “Professional Accreditation”, is designed to cover a very broad range of professions. SVP intends to target over 1,000 specialised occupations across 23 major sectors under the national occupational classification system.
        </p>
        <p>
          The covered occupations include many technical, vocational, skilled-trade, and blue-collar jobs, for example: electricians, plumbers, welders, HVAC technicians, construction-related trades, mechanical and electrical technicians, machine operators, auto mechanics, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          The programme is specifically important for Indian workers applying for skilled and semi-skilled roles. Clearing the SVP test improves your employment credibility and prevents visa rejection.

          <img
            src={SkillsVerficationImg}

        </div>
 <p>
          Saudi Arabia conducts skill verification through two tracks, and Indian workers may fall under either depending on their employment situation.
        </p>
        <h3 className="h5 fw-bold mt-4">1. External Verification (Before Entering Saudi Arabia)</h3>
        <p>This track applies to new Indian workers travelling to Saudi Arabia for the first time.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You must take and pass the SVP test India before your Saudi work visa is issued.</li>
          <li>The test includes: Written / Theory questions and practical, hands-on skill assessment.</li>
          <li>Saudi Arabia has authorised SVP testing centres across major regions in India.</li>
          <li>If you pass, you receive a 5-year valid Skill Verification Certificate, which is essential for visa processing.</li>
          <li>Angel Gulf Jobs guides Indian candidates in registering for the test, selecting centres, preparing for exams, and ensuring all documents meet Saudi requirements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="h5 fw-bold mt-4">2. Internal Verification (Already Working in Saudi Arabia)</h3>
        <p>This track applies to Indian expatriates currently employed in Saudi Arabia.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Saudi companies can register their Indian workers for the test internally.</li>
          <li>Tests take place at approved verification centres inside Saudi Arabia.</li>
          <li>Once passed, workers receive a Professional Verification Certificate.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section className="blog-section mb-5">
        <h2 className="h3 fw-bold section-title-blue">What the SVP Trade Testing Includes For Indian Job Seekers</h2>
        <p>The Skill Verification Programme has two major components, each designed to ensure real, verifiable professional competency.</p>
        <h3 className="h5 fw-bold mt-4">A. Theory Test (Written Examination)</h3>
        <p>This is usually conducted on a computer and includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Multiple-choice or structured questions</li>
          <li>Workplace safety and compliance knowledge</li>
          <li>Tools and equipment identification</li>
          <li>Basic technical concepts</li>
          <li>Troubleshooting scenarios</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="h5 fw-bold mt-4">B. Practical Test (Hands-On Skills Assessment)</h3>
        <p>This is the most important part and reflects your real skills, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Performing job-specific tasks</li>
          <li>Using tools and equipment correctly</li>
          <li>Demonstrating precision, speed, and safety</li>
          <li>Following Saudi work standards</li>
          <li>Completing assignments in front of certified examiners</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Angel Gulf Jobs connects candidates with pre-test training centres to boost their chances of a successful employment contract.</p>

      <section className="blog-section mb-5">
        <h2 className="h3 fw-bold section-title-blue">Documents Required for SVP</h2>
        <p>To take the Saudi Arabia Skill Verification Program or SVP test and proceed with recruitment, Indian applicants need:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Passport</li>
          <li>Aadhaar or local ID</li>
          <li>Job offer/contract</li>
          <li>Passport photos</li>
          <li>SVP registration slip</li>
          <li>Skill certificates (applicable for experienced professionals)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Angel Gulf Jobs verifies all documents to ensure the smooth processing of your test and work visa.</p>

          />
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Greater Job Security for Workers: Certified workers are more valued, more employable, and less likely to face job loss or visa complications.</li>
          <li>Better Pay & Career Growth: Skilled professionals have higher earning potential and more opportunities for promotions and specialised roles.</li>
          <li>Safer Work Environments: With trained talent on site, companies see fewer accidents and better adherence to safety standards.</li>
          <li>Easier Visa Approvals for Workers: SVP-certified candidates enjoy smoother and faster visa processing.</li>
          <li>Higher Productivity for Companies: Employers gain reliable, skilled staff—reducing turnover, increasing output, and improving quality standards.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In short, SVP benefits everyone: workers, employers, and the Kingdom’s economic progress.</p>
