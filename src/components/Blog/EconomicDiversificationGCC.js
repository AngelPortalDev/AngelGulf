      <section className="blog-section mb-5">
        <p className="lead fw-normal intro-text">
          The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Oman have
          long been global leaders, built on oil and gas wealth. But over the past decade, the region has been changing rapidly. The

          in GCC countries aims to reduce dependence on hydrocarbons and reshape their economies for long-term sustainable development.
        </p>

        <p>
          For Indian job seekers, this shift has opened new Gulf jobs for Indians, particularly within rapidly expanding industrial
          development, renewable energy, logistics, smart manufacturing, and digital infrastructure sectors. As GCC economies embrace
          industry and advanced technology, demand continues to rise for both technical and blue-collar manpower.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Angel Gulf Jobs, a trusted overseas manpower agency, we help bridge this opportunity gap. We connect Indian manpower for
          GCC industries with reputable employers across the Middle East. Our mission is to support skilled individuals in accessing
          high-potential jobs in GCC countries, aligned with regional transformation initiatives.

      {/* WHAT IS ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION */}
      <section className="blog-section mb-5">
        <h2 className="h3 fw-bold section-title-blue">What Is Economic Diversification?</h2>

        <p>
          Economic diversification refers to the process of expanding income sources beyond traditional sectors such as oil and gas.
          For GCC nations, this means driving investments in new and emerging fields, including:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Manufacturing and industrial development</li>
          <li>Renewable energy and sustainability projects</li>
          <li>Tourism, hospitality, and entertainment</li>
          <li>Information and communication technology (ICT)</li>
          <li>Finance, logistics, and education</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          These initiatives fall under national development plans such as Saudi Vision 2030, UAE Operation 300bn, Oman Vision 2040,
          and Bahrain Economic Vision 2030. Each of these frameworks strengthens GCC industries growth, driving large-scale job
          creation across sectors.
        </p>

        <p>
          For Indian workers, this shift has created a surge of industrial jobs in Gulf countries, expanding continuous employment
          opportunities in the Gulf—from technicians and operators to engineers and ICT specialists.
        </p>

        <p>
          As GCC nations modernise their economies, they require a diverse and reliable talent pool, particularly from India, which
          remains one of the region’s strongest manpower partners.
        </p>
      </section>

      {/* IMPACT ON EMPLOYMENT AND MANPOWER DEMAND */}
      <section className="blog-section mb-5">
        <h2 className="h3 fw-bold section-title-blue">Impact on Employment and Manpower Demand</h2>

        <p>
          The push toward diversification is reshaping the private sector and increasing demand for white-collar and blue-collar
          professionals. Major national projects guided by ministries such as the Ministry of Industry and Advanced Technology (MoIAT)
          in the UAE are fostering industrial resilience, digital innovation, and stronger supply chains.
        </p>

        <p>This transformation is generating jobs in GCC countries for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Electricians, plumbers, welders, and mechanics</li>
          <li>Heavy equipment operators, drivers, and technicians</li>
          <li>Construction labourers, fabricators, and machine operators</li>
          <li>HVAC technicians, pipeline workers, and maintenance crews</li>
          <li>Engineers, IT specialists & digital transformation experts</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          For Indian professionals, this means consistent and long-term employment opportunities in Gulf markets driven by industrial
          and technological innovation.
        </p>

        <p>
          As economic diversification in GCC accelerates, these roles form the backbone of rapid infrastructure expansion—industrial
          cities, smart factories, renewable energy plants, logistics zones, and advanced technology hubs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Economic diversification in GCC countries is setting the stage for a new era of growth. By 2030, most Gulf nations aim for
          non-oil sectors to lead national GDP, powered by innovation, advanced technology, and sustainable development models. This
          evolution ensures rising opportunities for Indian workers—especially in technical and blue-collar fields that drive the
          region’s industrial success.
