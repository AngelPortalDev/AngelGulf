        <h2 className="h3 fw-bold section-title-blue">What Is the Qiwa Platform in Saudi Arabia?</h2>
        <p>
          Qiwa is an official digital platform launched by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development (MHRSD) of Saudi Arabia.
        </p>
        <p>
          It acts as a one-stop hub for all labour and employment services, providing both employers and expatriate workers with a transparent, standardised, and secure way to manage employment processes for jobs in Saudi Arabia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Qiwa replaces older systems and brings everything under one modern platform, making it easier to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Verify employment contracts</li>
          <li>Track work permit status</li>
          <li>Ensure labour law compliance</li>

        <h2 className="h3 fw-bold section-title-blue">Why Saudi Arabia Introduced Qiwa: Labour Protection at Its Core</h2>
        <p>
          Saudi Arabia’s labour market includes millions of expatriates from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, the Philippines, and more. To support this workforce and improve labour transparency, Saudi Arabia introduced Qiwa to achieve three major goals:
        </p>
        <h3 className="h5 fw-bold mt-4">1. Strengthen worker protection and rights</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Employment contracts cannot be changed without worker's approval.</li>
          <li>Workers can review and confirm all job details digitally.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 className="h5 fw-bold mt-4">2. Improve the hiring and recruitment process</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Reduces fraudulent job offers and illegal agents.</li>
          <li>All employer and employee records are verified on Qiwa.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 className="h5 fw-bold mt-4">3. Support Saudi Vision 2030 labour reforms</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Promotes a modern labour ecosystem.</li>
          <li>Enhances transparency, fairness, and accountability.</li>
        </ul>

      <section className="blog-section mb-5">
        <h2 className="h3 fw-bold section-title-blue">Key Features and Benefits of Qiwa for Workers &amp; Employers</h2>
        <p>
          Qiwa offers several services that help overseas workers and employers manage labour procedures efficiently.
        </p>

        <h3 className="h5 fw-bold mt-4">1. Digital Employment Contract Verification</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Workers can view, verify, and approve their employment contracts online.</li>
          <li>No employer can alter contract conditions without worker consent.</li>
          <li>Prevents contract substitution or fraudulent changes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="h5 fw-bold mt-4">2. Work Permit Management</h3>
        <p>
          Qiwa provides complete visibility into:
        </p>

          <li>Work permit validity</li>
          <li>Renewal status</li>
          <li>Transfer eligibility</li>
          <li>Employer fees and compliance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This helps overseas workers track their legal status and avoid unexpected visa issues when looking for jobs in Saudi Arabia.
        </p>

        <h3 className="h5 fw-bold mt-4">3. Job Mobility and Employer Transfer</h3>
        <p>
          Under the <a href="https://www.hrsd.gov.sa/en/media-center/news/770957" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Labour Reform Initiative (LRI)</a>, Qiwa allows workers to transfer employers under certain conditions without needing approval from their current sponsor. It has significantly reduced exploitation of migrant labourers.
        </p>

        <h3 className="h5 fw-bold mt-4">4. Filing Complaints &amp; Dispute Resolution</h3>

        </p>
        <ul>
