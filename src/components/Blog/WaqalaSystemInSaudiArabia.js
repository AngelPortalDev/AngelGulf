        <p>
          When hiring foreign workers for jobs in Saudi Arabia, employers need
          to follow a clear legal process to make sure the recruitment process
          and visa application process run smoothly. A key part of this process
          is the Waqala system in Saudi Arabia. The Waqala system is a formal
          authorisation that allows a recruitment agency, like Angel Gulf Jobs,
          to handle important administrative tasks on the Saudi employer’s
          behalf for jobs in Saudi Arabia. It helps simplify and speed up the
          overall Saudi work visa process for Indians looking for jobs in Saudi
          Arabia.

          What is the Saudi Waqala for Recruitment?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Waqala is a legal document that functions as a power of
          attorney, commonly referred to as the Waqala power of attorney
          Saudi—issued by a Saudi employer or sponsor for jobs in Saudi
          Arabia. It authorises a third party, usually a licensed overseas
          recruitment agency like Angel Gulf Jobs, to handle all
          administrative and bureaucratic tasks related to hiring foreign
          nationals looking for jobs in Saudi Arabia.

          The Purpose of the Saudi Waqala for Recruitment
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Saudi Waqala for recruitment is designed to simplify and
          streamline the complex procedures involved in obtaining employment
          visas for jobs in Saudi Arabia. When a Saudi employer issues a
          Waqala, they legally authorise a recruitment agency such as Angel
          Gulf Jobs to communicate with key Saudi authorities, such as the
          Ministry of Human Resources, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
          (MOFA), and, when required, the Saudi Chamber of Commerce. This
          authorisation ensures:
        </p>
        <ul className="blog-bullet-list">
          <li>
            Faster processing of employment visas and related approvals for
            jobs in Saudi Arabia.
          </li>
          <li>
            Accurate handling of documentation and educational certificates,
            reducing the chance of errors or delays
          </li>
          <li>
            Full compliance with Saudi labour laws and immigration
            regulations, protecting both the employer and the worker
          </li>
          <li>
            Seamless coordination between the employer, government
            authorities, and workers for quicker decision-making, timely
            updates, and smooth end-to-end recruitment process for jobs in
            Saudi Arabia.

          How the Waqala System Works
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Waqala becomes active after the Saudi employer completes the initial hiring permissions. Below is a simplified, step-by-step flow of how the Saudi employer Waqala process works:
        </p>
        
        <div className="mt-4">
          <h3 className="h4 fw-bold">1. Employer Applies for a Block Visa</h3>
          <p>Before hiring foreign workers, the Saudi employer must apply for a block visa through the Ministry of Human Resources. This block visa specifies:</p>
          <ul className="blog-bullet-list">
            <li>Number of foreign workers</li>
            <li>Nationalities</li>
            <li>Job titles</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Once approved, the employer may proceed with individual recruitment and a visa for Saudi Arabia.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="mt-4">
          <h3 className="h4 fw-bold">2. Employer Issues a Waqala to Angel Gulf Jobs</h3>
          <p>After the block visa is approved, the employer in Saudi Arabia begins the Waqala MOFA Saudi Arabia process by issuing a Waqala (power of attorney) to a trusted overseas Gulf Job consultant, such as Angel Gulf Jobs.</p>
          <p>It authorises Angel Gulf Jobs permissions to:</p>
          <ul className="blog-bullet-list">
            <li>Source qualified Indian candidates</li>
            <li>Manage all recruitment paperwork</li>
            <li>Coordinate medical tests and obtain medical reports</li>
            <li>Facilitate attestation of educational and professional documents</li>
          </ul>
          <p>With this authorisation, Angel Gulf Jobs represents the employer in all official processes required for hiring manpower from India.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="mt-4">
          <h3 className="h4 fw-bold">3. Angel Gulf Jobs Completes the Visa Procedures</h3>
          <p>Using the Waqala, our recruitment specialists at Angel Gulf Jobs, a trusted overseas manpower consultancy, help you to:</p>
          <ul className="blog-bullet-list">
            <li>Prepare and submit the worker's visa application</li>
            <li>Coordinate with MOFA and other Saudi authorities</li>

            <li>Arrange necessary medical tests</li>
            <li>Complete embassy stamping and payment of any applicable visa fees</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This completes the formalities required for travel to Saudi Arabia and the subsequent Iqama (residence visa) processing for long-term employment.</p>

        <h2 className="h3 fw-bold section-title-blue">Electronic Wakala (E-Wakala):</h2>

          Wakala documents are often issued electronically through the Saudi

          www.visa.mofa.gov.sa) known as E-Wakala.
        </p>
        <p>
          The E-Wakala includes details such as the visa number, the
          sponsor’s ID, and the name of the authorised agent or agency, such
