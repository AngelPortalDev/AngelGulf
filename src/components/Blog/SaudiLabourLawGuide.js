        <h2 className="h3 fw-bold section-title-blue">The Evolution of Saudi Arabia Labour Law (2021–2025 Reforms)</h2>
        <p>
          Over recent years, the Saudi Arabian government has significantly modernised labour regulations to increase fairness, mobility, and transparency for both employers and employees. These reforms also enhance accountability, ensure compliance, and support ethical hiring practices for Saudi Arabia job opportunities.
        </p>
        <h3 className="h5 fw-bold mt-4">Key Updates for Employees/Jobseekers</h3>
        <p>
          Saudi Arabia has introduced major improvements that help foreign workers and support safer work environments. These include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you are a job seeker in Saudi Arabia, you can change your employer without a No Objection Certificate (NOC) at the end of an employment contract.</li>
          <li>As a foreign national, after completing one year in the country, you can now transfer jobs after 90 days of your notice period.</li>
          <li>You can also get a digital approval of your employment contracts through official government portals.</li>
          <li>You, as a foreign worker, can file a complaint with the Ministry of Labour, Saudi Arabian Government and other authorities quickly and securely.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 className="h5 fw-bold mt-4">Key Updates for Employers</h3>
        <p>Employers in Saudi Arabia also benefit from clearer rules and structured procedures:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Employers in Saudi Arabia now have transparent processes for terminating employees’ indefinite or fixed-term contracts</li>
          <li>The Saudi Labour Law clearly defines the notice period. Once this notice period is completed, the employer can release the employee if they wish to move to another job.</li>
          <li>Legal grounds for dismissal of employees based on misconduct, absence, or unsafe behaviour have been defined in the Saudi Labour Law.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These changes through the Saudi Labour Law reduce dependency on employers and give Indian workers more freedom while living and working in Saudi Arabia. At Angel Gulf Jobs, we as a leading manpower consultancy, provide clear guidance to candidates seeking jobs in Saudi Arabia, helping them choose opportunities that match their skills and goals.

        <p>
          Every foreign national must receive a written, legally compliant employment contract before starting jobs in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi employment contract must include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Salary, allowances, and benefits</li>
          <li>Job role and work description</li>
          <li>Working hours and overtime terms</li>

        <h2 className="h3 fw-bold section-title-blue">Leave Entitlements Under Saudi Labour Law</h2>

        <h2 className="h3 fw-bold section-title-blue">Salary, Payroll, Deductions, Wage Protection & Termination</h2>
        <p>
          Under the Saudi Labour Law, salary payments and wage protection are taken very seriously.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Saudi Arabia sets a minimum wage of SAR 4,000 for Saudi nationals for Saudisation purposes.</li>
          <li>There is no fixed minimum wage for expatriates, but their salaries must match the employment contract.</li>
          <li>Salaries must be paid monthly, through a bank via the Wage Protection System (WPS), and in Saudi Riyals, unless another currency has been mutually agreed upon.</li>
          <li>To end an employment contract, employees must give notice. Monthly-paid employees need to give 60 days’ notice. Other employees need to give 30 days.</li>
          <li>Your employment contract can also end if you engage in misconduct, repeated absenteeism, poor performance, or unsafe behaviour. You can resign without giving notice if your salary is not paid, if your employer breaks the contract, if your workplace is unsafe, or if you face any form of harassment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These protections demonstrate Saudi Arabia’s commitment to fair treatment under its Labour Law.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, understanding Saudi Labour Law, Saudi work visa requirements, employee rights, and employment contract rules is essential for anyone planning to live and work in Saudi Arabia. Whether you are looking for jobs in Saudi Arabia from your home country or are already employed in Saudi Arabia, staying informed helps ensure compliance, safety, and success.
