        <p className="lead fw-normal">
          Saudi Arabia has introduced a major reform in its labour system — a skill-based work permit model designed to regulate how foreign nationals enter, work, and build careers in the Kingdom. This reform is part of the long-term transformation plan known as Saudi Vision 2030, led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, which aims to strengthen the private sector, enhance transparency, and make Saudi Arabia a global talent hub.
        </p>

        <p>
          The new system standardises the work permit application, job classification, and recruitment processes through two digital government systems:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Qiwa Digital Platform</li>
          <li>Mudad System</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These platforms now oversee all work permit applications, renewals, and employment contracts.
        </p>
        <p>
          This policy is a game-changer for foreign workers, overseas recruiters, and companies relying on international recruitment.
        </p>

      <section className="blog-section mb-5">
        <h2 className="h3 fw-bold section-title-blue">What Is the Skill-Based Work Permit System?</h2>
        <p>
          The new system categorises applicants into three levels:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>High-Skilled</li>
          <li>Skilled</li>
          <li>Basic</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The classification depends on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Education (high school or above)</li>
          <li>Work experience</li>
          <li>Salary bracket</li>
          <li>Age</li>
          <li>Professional accreditation</li>
          <li>SSCO (Saudi Standard Classification of Occupations)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This approach replaces the older model that focused mostly on job titles and sponsorships. Now, permit applicants are evaluated based on their actual skills, credibility, and eligibility — offering fair opportunities for every foreign national entering the Saudi job market.
        </p>

      <section className="blog-section mb-5">
        <h2 className="h3 fw-bold section-title-blue">How does the 2025 Work Permit Classification Work?</h2>
        <p>1. High-Skilled Level: This tier is for top professionals who meet the highest standards set by the Saudi Ministry of Human Resources.</p>
        <p>To qualify, an applicant must:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Work in occupational groups (1 to 3) under the SSCO. These include managers, professionals, and technicians.</li>
          <li>Earn a salary that matches the high-skilled wage threshold.</li>
          <li>Meet all requirements of the Professional Accreditation Program.</li>
          <li>Pass a points-based evaluation covering education, work experience, and wage level.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Typical Roles Include: Engineers, IT professionals, doctors, financial analysts, and managers — key contributors to Kingdom-wide projects like Red Sea development and Vision 2030 initiatives.
        </p>

        <p>2. Skilled Level: For workers with strong technical or administrative backgrounds.</p>
        <p>Eligibility:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The applicant must belong to SCCO occupational groups 4 to 8.</li>
          <li>Earn the minimum salary required for their level.</li>
          <li>Meet the Professional Accreditation Program criteria for their field.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Common Roles: Supervisors, technicians, machine operators, administrative staff, sales representatives, and mid-level workers.
        </p>

        <p>3. Basic level: The basic work permits applies to workers whose job roles require limited training or formal education.</p>
        <p>Eligibility criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Belong to SCCO group (9), which includes general labour roles</li>
          <li>Meeting the Professional Accreditation Program standards, if applicable.</li>
          <li>Be under 60 years of age.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Common roles include helpers, cleaners, drivers, and certain categories of domestic workers. Even if workers belong to higher occupational groups, they may still be classified here if their wages fall below the Skilled Level threshold.
        </p>

      <section className="blog-section mb-5">
        <h2 className="h3 fw-bold section-title-blue">Key Benefits by Skill Level</h2>
        <p><strong>High-Skilled:</strong> Premium Iqama validity up to 5 years, job mobility without no-objection certificates, family sponsorship eligibility and faster pathways to special residency programs for exceptional talent</p>
        <p><strong>Skilled:</strong> Two-year work permits with easier renewals and controlled job mobility options after completing contractual notice periods.</p>
        <p><strong>Basic:</strong> One-year work permits, contract-end exit without employer approval and improved transparency for lower-income foreign workers</p>
        <p>
          This tiered system offers clarity for both workers and employers, forming the foundation of a more structured and fair recruitment ecosystem.
