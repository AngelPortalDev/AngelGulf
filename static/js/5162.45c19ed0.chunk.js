GCC economies have grown five-fold to reach $1.6 trillion over the past 15 years, while the population has risen nearly 80 per cent due to rapid domestic population expansion and influx of expatriates. The remarkable growth has made huge demands on infrastructure from roads to rail, healthcare services to education, with virtually every segment of the supporting industries being stretched to their limits including power and energy sector. This has resulted into generation of huge number of power & energy plant jobs attracting masses from different parts of the world. Truly speaking, power is one of the core sectors of any economy and is the major driving force behind industrialization and infrastructure development. Lack of ample power generation and related facilities cause not only inconvenience, but also economic loss due to reduced industrial production. The smooth functioning of the above sectors and continuous economic growth can be achieved if and only if power is generated in ample and is managed professionally."})]}),(0,j.jsx)("p",{children:"The tremendous growth seen in the industry has resulted into huge demand for qualified professionals at various levels with extensive experience and complete understanding of industry requirements.
