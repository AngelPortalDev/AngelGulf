It may come as news to\r\n                      some that the rupee started at dollar parity in 1947, when\r\n                      India achieved its independence. At that time, the rupee\r\n                      followed the par value system, wherein the value of rupee\r\n                      was pegged at 4.15 grains of fine gold. The first\r\n                      depreciation of the rupee happened in 1966, when its value\r\n                      fell overnight by almost 56 per cent to 1.83 grains of\r\n                      fine gold.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      That ‘devaluation’ meant that in the foreign exchange\r\n                      market, the rupee was cheaper by 37.5 per cent against the\r\n                      US dollar, from Rs4.75 per $1, it fell to Rs7.50 in a\r\n                      single stroke.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      With that perspective, a further decline of 8 per cent in\r\n                      the next 12 months isn’t out of the question, and an\r\n                      exchange rate of Rs74 against $1 (Rs20.14 vs Dh1) is quite\r\n                      likely given the current dismal form of the Indian\r\n                      currency\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      The past week saw the rupee plummet by more than 1.5 per\r\n                      cent, its biggest weekly drop in about a year-and-a-half.\r\n                      The benchmark BSE Sensex stock market index exaggerated\r\n                      the rupee’s weekly decline, sinking by 1.9 per cent.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      The Sensex is now down 6.5 per cent this year so far, with\r\n                      the rupee shedding more than 2.5 per cent of its worth in\r\n                      the same period.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      From those lofty peaks last year, the rupee is weaker by\r\n                      almost 11 per cent while the benchmark equity index is\r\n                      down 17.6 per cent.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      Just one year ago, the rupee was trading at Rs16.68\r\n                      against Dh1 (January 28, 2015) while the Sensex was\r\n                      scaling new heights and was soaring at 29,681 points.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      So, what happened and, more importantly, is it likely to\r\n                      continue?\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      To be fair, there are plenty of reasons for the decline,\r\n                      but we list the top 5 that we believe have been and will\r\n                      continue to impact the rupee the most going forward.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      #1 Ballooning current account deficit: India’s exports\r\n                      have been falling short of covering its imports (largely\r\n                      of oil and gold) in recent years, and that’s been the bane\r\n                      of its problems.

Among the BRICs, Brazil and\r\n                      Russia are already in recession, and China’s growth is\r\n                      slowing down dramatically.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      The past six months have seen investors pull out a mammoth\r\n                      $600 billion from China, at the rate of $100bn a month. It\r\n                      still has plenty ($3.3 trillion) worth of foreign\r\n                      investments left, but the same cannot be said for any\r\n                      other emerging economy, including India. The only saving\r\n                      grace is that India is a net commodity importer and,\r\n                      therefore, the low global commodity prices help its\r\n                      finances unlike the other major emerging economies.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      But if the world does fall into recession, there will be\r\n                      less demand for India’s soft exports (services), and\r\n                      that’ll translate into an imported recession. Even if\r\n                      there’s no hard landing, a global slowdown will continue\r\n                      to impact the Indian currency negatively.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      #4 US recovery and end of QE: The US Federal Reserve\r\n                      raised interest rates by a quarter percentage point in\r\n                      December 2105 after almost a decade of near-zero borrowing\r\n                      cost for US consumers.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      The Fed has indicated that it will be hiking the interest\r\n                      rate further this year on the back of a sustained US\r\n                      economic growth.
