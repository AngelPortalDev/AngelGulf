Several fields\r\n                      of employment are rising now in Dubai. “Nearly 66 per cent\r\n                      of UAE companies have hired new employees in the last six\r\n                      months, compared to 63 per cent around the Middle East and\r\n                      North Africa (Mena) region who have done so,” he added.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <h2 className=\"blueuText\">\r\n                      What do UAE employers look for in new hires?\r\n                    </h2>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      “Our latest research, the Bayt.com Mena Job Index Survey,\r\n                      which was conducted in July 2014, reveals the skills\r\n                      sought after by employers in potential new hires,” he\r\n                      said. According to the survey, employers in the UAE are\r\n                      looking for candidates who have good communication skills\r\n                      in Arabic and English (60 per cent), who are team players\r\n                      (50 per cent), have good leadership skills (45 per cent),\r\n                      and good negotiation skills (45 per cent). “In terms of\r\n                      experience, employers in the UAE mostly look out for\r\n                      candidates who have the ability to manage a team, who have\r\n                      worked in sales and marketing or in administration.\r\n                      Keeping this in mind, jobseekers must work on the relevant\r\n                      skills and experience,” he added.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      “In fact 67 per cent of companies are definitely hiring in\r\n                      the next three months. Nearly 74 per cent claim they will\r\n                      either ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ be hiring, in a year’s\r\n                      time. Interestingly, 21 per cent of companies will look to\r\n                      fill up to between six to ten positions, most of which, 36\r\n                      per cent, will be for junior executive roles. According to\r\n                      the Bayt.com Modern Job Research in the Mena poll, which\r\n                      was conducted in November 2013, around 41 per cent of\r\n                      employers always research candidates online at first. “It\r\n                      is a perfect time for jobseekers to get online and get\r\n                      noticed by employers,” Masri said. Construction, banking\r\n                      and finance, oil, gas and petrochemicals are the fields\r\n                      that require employees currently.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      “When it comes to fields that require employees currently,\r\n                      UAE respondents believe that industries which are most\r\n                      attractive as well as retain the top talent are\r\n                      construction (39 per cent) and banking and finance (39 per\r\n                      cent), followed by oil, gas, and petrochemicals (35 per\r\n                      cent),” he said. “However, in the next three months, UAE\r\n                      companies will seek sales managers (19 per cent), customer\r\n                      service representatives (15 per cent), human resources\r\n                      professionals (14 per cent), project managers (14 per\r\n                      cent), and executive assistants (14 per cent),” he added.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      Business management and engineering are the top list\r\n                      qualification of candidates. “The most sought after\r\n                      qualification among candidates in the Mena region is\r\n                      business management at graduate or postgraduate level. In\r\n                      the UAE, the most desirable qualification is one in\r\n                      engineering, followed by business management and commerce.\r\n                      As the UAE has developed a gamut of higher education\r\n                      institutions, jobseekers can easily choose to pursue these\r\n                      qualifications,” Masri said.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      Courtesy: <NavLink to=\"/\"> Gulf Jobs In Mumbai</NavLink>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        {/* Employer Detail END */}\r\n      </div>\r\n      {/* CONTENT END */}\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default UaeJobMarketOutlook;\r\n"],"names":["UaeJobMarketOutlook","_jsxs","children","Helmet","_jsx","name","content","rel","href","className","style","backgroundImage","uaeJobseeker","NavLink","to"],"sourceRoot":""}
