If you are on the lookout for a job\r\n                in the UAE and are trying to make sense of your initial job\r\n                search, this recent data can help you narrow down your options.\r\n                A report from dubizzle, a UAE-based classifieds website, reveals\r\n                the most common questions that the country’s employers ask\r\n                candidates.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                “The most popular question asked of an accounting jobseeker was:\r\n                ‘Do you have experience as an income auditor?’ while for sales,\r\n                most employers enquired about previous sales experience in the\r\n                UAE and GCC,” dubizzle’s 2015 job report highlights. For\r\n                healthcare professionals, the most common question posed was\r\n                “are you a female HADD/DHA-licensed or exam-passed nurse?” For\r\n                electrical engineer, employers wanted to know if the candidate\r\n                had passed the Dubai Municipality test and for administrative\r\n                jobs, the most commonly asked question was: “Are you based in\r\n                Dubai?”\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Job postings for infographic designers ask for certification or\r\n                a degree in a relevant field, and real estate positions seek a\r\n                valid Rera card. Certifications are also a prerequisite in\r\n                medical healthcare and engineering as some common questions. For\r\n                example, it’s good to know what kind of jobs are advertised the\r\n                most; ones that have many candidates applying for; who all are\r\n                your competitors and the kind of question that the employers are\r\n                most likely to ask you.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>Most popular job in UAE</p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                It’s raining accountants in the UAE. According to the report,\r\n                accounting is the most popular job sector in Dubai in 2015, with\r\n                more than 38,000 individual ads posted and a staggering 10\r\n                million applicants vying for the roles. That works out to about\r\n                263 candidates per advertised accountancy vacancy. The\r\n                secretarial and sales sectors follow, with more job ads posted\r\n                (42,000 and 77,000, respectively) but fewer applicants (5\r\n                million for secretarial posting and 4 million for sales jobs).\r\n                That works out to an average of 119 applications per secretarial\r\n                job and just about 52 applications per sales vacancy. More than\r\n                33,000 jobs were posted last year in real estate, with just over\r\n                half a million (522,000) applicants while the transportation\r\n                sector followed with fewer ads (22,000) but more applicants\r\n                (825,000), the data reveals.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>Abu Dhabi jobs</p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                In Abu Dhabi too, accounting was the most listed sector in the\r\n                job section but unlike Dubai, it was followed by\r\n                hospitality/restaurant jobs, secretarial, sales and\r\n                medical/healthcare jobs. Finance and accounting, however, have\r\n                taken a dip in January of this year. The latest Monster\r\n                Employment Index for the country shows the sector has been UAE’s\r\n                lowest growth occupations last month when compared to the same\r\n                period in 2015. Considering the year-over-year growth (January\r\n                2015 and January 2016), the Monster Index shows that finance and\r\n                accounting, marketing & communications/arts/creative and\r\n                customer service were the worst performers among the occupations\r\n                that the index tracks.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Source:{\" \"}\r\n                <a\r\n                  href=\"http://www.emirates247.com\"\r\n                  rel=\"noreferrer\"\r\n                  target=\"_blank\"\r\n                >\r\n                  http://www.emirates247.com\r\n                </a>{\" \"}\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Courtesy: <NavLink to=\"/\">Gulf Jobs</NavLink>{\" \"}\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        {/* Employer Detail END */}\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default RetirementAgeUpdate;\r\n"],"names":["RetirementAgeUpdate","_jsxs","children","Helmet","_jsx","name","content","rel","href","className","style","backgroundImage","JobAlert","NavLink","to","target"],"sourceRoot":""}
