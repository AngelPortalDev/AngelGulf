The rupee continued its\r\n                      unabashed rise over all six sessions since the country's\r\n                      Budget 2016 was presented on the last day of February,\r\n                      staging a euphoric comeback to mark the currency's biggest\r\n                      weekly gains since September 2013. Several expats who were\r\n                      waiting for their February salaries to remit at the ‘best\r\n                      ever’ exchange rate were disappointed as the rupee began\r\n                      an incredible rally just before they could actually remit.\r\n                      The proverbial tide in the sentiment towards India as an\r\n                      investment destination and the Indian rupee seems to be\r\n                      turning for the better, with the rupee and equities\r\n                      emerging as the biggest beneficiaries of the post-budget\r\n                      week (see chart below).\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      The rupee rose 2.9 per cent in a week, from near an\r\n                      all-time low of Rs68.899 vs $1 [Rs18.758 vs Dh1] on\r\n                      Thursday, February 25, 2016, to Rs66.885 vs $1 [Rs18.209\r\n                      vs Dh1] on Friday, March 4, 2016. The benchmark Bombay\r\n                      Stock Exchange Sensitivity Index (BSE Sensex) was trading\r\n                      at 22,778 points when Jaitley was about half-an-hour into\r\n                      his 90-minute budget speech. The BSE Sensex index closed\r\n                      the week at 24,646 points, up 1,868 points – or 8.2 per\r\n                      cent – in five days. That’s the best post-budget week that\r\n                      the index has seen in a decade.”\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      The week gone by saw the rupee appreciate the most since\r\n                      it rose more than 7 per cent in the eight days between\r\n                      September 3 – 11, 2013, the week India’s rockstar central\r\n                      bank governor Raghuram Govind Rajan took the helm at\r\n                      Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Euphoria surrounding Rajan’s\r\n                      RBI takeover was in anticipation of the end of India’s\r\n                      ‘policy paralysis’ – a phrase that described the\r\n                      government’s inaction on various matters during Manmohan\r\n                      Singh’s second five-year term as Prime Minister. This\r\n                      time, though, it is in response to the measures announced\r\n                      in the budget. Jaitley announced increased spending on\r\n                      rural jobs programme, set aside money for higher\r\n                      government salaries and pensions, and announced a new\r\n                      health insurance plan.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      He also reiterated of the Indian government’s seriousness\r\n                      about reigning in the country’s fiscal deficit to a\r\n                      nine-year-low of 3.5 per cent of GDP in the forthcoming\r\n                      fiscal year. These, along with other measures he\r\n                      announced, did the trick and encouraged foreign investors\r\n                      to make a euphoric comeback into Indian equities, pushing\r\n                      the currency higher. And while the rupee’s gain is expats’\r\n                      loss (because they will have to spend more in the currency\r\n                      they earn to remit the same amount of rupees), not many\r\n                      are complaining. Even after the recent gains, the rupee is\r\n                      only at a two-and-a-half-month high, and is trading at\r\n                      mid-January, 2016, levels. Over the last one year, though,\r\n                      the rupee is still down more than 8 per cent over the\r\n                      highs achieved in early April 2015.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      Source:{\" \"}\r\n                      <NavLink\r\n                        to=\"http://www.emirates247.com/news/emirates\"\r\n                        target=\"_blank\"\r\n                      >\r\n                        http://www.emirates247.com/news/emirates\r\n                      </NavLink>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      Courtesy: <NavLink to=\"/\"> Gulf Jobs In Mumbai</NavLink>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        {/* Employer Detail END */}\r\n      </div>\r\n      {/* CONTENT END */}\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default IndianBudgetImpactOnRemitters;\r\n"],"names":["IndianBudgetImpactOnRemitters","_jsxs","children","Helmet","_jsx","name","content","rel","href","className","style","backgroundImage","indiabudgetImg","NavLink","to","target"],"sourceRoot":""}
