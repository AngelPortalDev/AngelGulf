Here’s how:\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>1. Remit it</p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      The first step to any potential investment – be it in\r\n                      Indian shares, property, or even a fixed-income deposit –\r\n                      will need you to first remit the money, and you should do\r\n                      it while the exchange rate is rewarding. You might want to\r\n                      accumulate your resources (the next salary cheque for most\r\n                      employees is 10 days away).\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>2. Prepay your outstanding debt</p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      It is no state secret that Indian nationals like to invest\r\n                      in property, and most NRIs secure a home in India before\r\n                      making property investment in the country they work in or\r\n                      elsewhere. Which means that many of us would have taken\r\n                      out home loans with Indian banks for properties in India?\r\n                      With interest rates beginning to go north now, the\r\n                      interest burden on that mortgage will go up too. It may be\r\n                      time to borrow cheap – some UAE banks and those in other\r\n                      Gulf States with a fixed peg to the dollar are still\r\n                      offering low borrowing rates – and prepay tat outstanding\r\n                      back home. Nevertheless, do your math before going for a\r\n                      prepayment by borrowing afresh and prepay only if you're\r\n                      making a reasonable saving in interest outgo.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>3. Explore fixed income options</p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      The recent revision in the US Federal Reserve’s interest\r\n                      rates has had their echoes heard across the world,\r\n                      including in the Indian banking system. You can still earn\r\n                      handsome returns (up to 9 per cent per annum) in fixed\r\n                      deposit products with some of India’s public sector banks.\r\n                      Keep in mind, though that the rupee could well depreciate\r\n                      at a similar rate, and you may not ‘earn’ anything on the\r\n                      deposit when compared with keeping your dirham or dollars\r\n                      in a non-interest-paying account.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>4. Invest in Indian shares</p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      Okay, this advice comes with a strong disclaimer – the\r\n                      Indian stock market, like others in the world, is\r\n                      undergoing a correction, and could easily fall another 10\r\n                      to 15 per cent from here on. But as the world renowned\r\n                      investor Warren Buffet once famously remarked – be fearful\r\n                      when others are greedy, and greedy when others are\r\n                      fearful. As markets reach their lows, it may be prudent to\r\n                      keep the cash ready and jump on the bandwagon once they’re\r\n                      on an upswing.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>5. Buy a house in India</p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      Again, do your homework before taking the plunge.
